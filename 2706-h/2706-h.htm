<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Matthew Gregory Lewis</span>, who
professed to have translated this romance out of the German, very
much, I believe, as Horace Walpole professed to have taken <i>The
Castle of Otranto</i> from an old Italian manuscript, was born in
1775 of a wealthy family.&nbsp; His father had an estate in India
and a post in a Government office.&nbsp; His mother was daughter
to Sir Thomas Sewell, Master of the Rolls in the reign of George
III.&nbsp; She was a young mother; her son Matthew was devoted to
her from the first.&nbsp; As a child he called her
&ldquo;Fanny,&rdquo; and as a man held firmly by her when she was
deserted by her husband.&nbsp; From Westminster School, M. G.
Lewis passed to Christ Church, Oxford.&nbsp; Already he was busy
over tales and plays, and wrote at college a farce, never acted,
a comedy, written at the age of sixteen, <i>The East Indian</i>,
afterwards played for Mrs. Jordan&rsquo;s benefit and repeated
with great success, and also a novel, never published, called
<i>The Effusions of Sensibility</i>, which was a burlesque upon
the sentimental school.&nbsp; He wrote also what he called
&ldquo;a romance in the style of <i>The Castle of
Otranto</i>,&rdquo; which appeared afterwards as the play of
<i>The Castle Spectre</i>.</p>
<p>With his mind thus interested in literature of the romantic
form, young Lewis, aged seventeen, after a summer in Paris, went
to Germany, settled for a time at Weimar, and, as he told his
mother, knocked his brains against German as hard as ever he
could.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been introduced,&rdquo; he wrote, in
July, 1792, &ldquo;to M. de Goethe, the celebrated author of
<i>Werter</i>, so you must not be surprised if I should shoot
myself one of these fine mornings.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the spring of
1793 the youth returned to England, very full of German romantic
tale and song, and with more paper covered with wild fancies of
his own.&nbsp; After the next Christmas he returned to
Oxford.&nbsp; There was a visit to Lord Douglas at Bothwell
Castle; there was not much academic work done at Oxford.&nbsp;
His father&rsquo;s desire was to train him for the diplomatic
service, and in the summer of 1794 he went to the Hague as
attach&eacute; to the British Embassy.&nbsp; He had begun to
write his novel of <i>The Monk</i>, had flagged, but was spurred
on at the Hague by a reading of Mrs. Radcliffe&rsquo;s
<i>Mysteries of Udolpho</i>, a book after his own heart, and he
wrote to his mother at this time, &ldquo;You see I am horribly
bit by the rage of writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Monk</i> was written in ten weeks, and published in the
summer of 1795, before its author&rsquo;s age was twenty.&nbsp;
It was praised, attacked, said by one review to have neither
originality, morals, nor probability to recommend it, yet to have
excited and to be continuing to excite the curiosity of the
public: a result set down to the &ldquo;irresistible energy of
genius.&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly, Lewis did not trouble himself to
keep probability in view; he amused himself with wild play of a
fancy that delighted in the wonderful.&nbsp; The controversy over
<i>The Monk</i> caused the young author to be known as Monk
Lewis, and the word Monk has to this day taken the place of the
words Matthew Gregory so generally, that many catalogue-makers
must innocently suppose him to have been so named at the
font.&nbsp; The author of <i>The Monk</i> came back from the
Hague to be received as a young lion in London society.&nbsp;
When he came of age he entered Parliament for Hindon, in
Wiltshire, but seldom went to the House, never spoke in it, and
retired after a few sessions.&nbsp; His delight was in the use of
the pen; his father, although disappointed by his failure as a
statesman, allowed him a thousand a year, and he took a cottage
at Barnes, that he might there escape from the world to his
ink-bottle.&nbsp; He was a frequent visitor at Inverary Castle,
and was fascinated by his host&rsquo;s daughter, Lady Charlotte
Campbell.&nbsp; Still he wrote on.&nbsp; The musical drama of
<i>The Castle Spectre</i> was produced in the year after <i>The
Monk</i>, and it ran sixty nights.&nbsp; He translated next
Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Kabale und Liebe</i> as <i>The Minister</i>,
but it was not acted till it appeared, with little success, some
years afterwards at Covent Garden as <i>The Harper&rsquo;s
Daughter</i>.&nbsp; He translated from Kotzebue, under the name
of <i>Rolla</i>, the drama superseded by Sheridan&rsquo;s version
of the same work as <i>Pizarro</i>.&nbsp; Then came the acting,
in 1799, of his comedy written in boyhood, <i>The East
Indian</i>.&nbsp; Then came, in the same year, his first opera,
<i>Adelmorn the Outlaw</i>; then a tragedy, <i>Alfonso</i>,
<i>King of Castile</i>.&nbsp; Of the origin of this tragedy Lewis
gave a characteristic account.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hearing one
day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my introduction of negroes into a
feudal baron&rsquo;s castle&rdquo; (in <i>The Castle Spectre</i>)
&ldquo;exclaimed against with as much vehemence as if a dramatic
anachronism had been an offence undeserving of benefit of clergy,
I said in a moment of petulance, that to prove of how little
consequence I esteemed such errors, I would make a play upon the
Gunpowder Plot, and make Guy Faux in love with the Emperor
Charlemagne&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; By some chance or other, this
idea fastened itself upon me, and by dint of turning it in my
mind, I at length formed the plot of <i>Alfonso</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To that time in Lewis&rsquo;s life belongs this book, <i>The
Bravo of Venice</i>; which was published in 1804, when the
writer&rsquo;s age was twenty-nine.&nbsp; It was written at
Inverary Castle, dedicated to the Earl of Moira, and received as
one of the most perfect little romances of its kind,
&ldquo;highly characteristic of the exquisite contrivance, bold
colouring, and profound mystery of the German
school.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1805 Lewis recast it into a melodrama,
which he called <i>Rugantino</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">H.M.</p>
<h2>Book the First.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">VENICE.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was evening.&nbsp; Multitudes of
light clouds, partially illumined by the moonbeams, overspread
the horizon, and through them floated the full moon in tranquil
majesty, while her splendour was reflected by every wave of the
Adriatic Sea.&nbsp; All was hushed around; gently was the water
rippled by the night wind; gently did the night wind sigh through
the Colonnades of Venice.</p>
<p>It was midnight; and still sat a stranger, solitary and sad,
on the border of the great canal.&nbsp; Now with a glance he
measured the battlements and proud towers of the city; and now he
fixed his melancholy eyes upon the waters with a vacant
stare.&nbsp; At length he spoke&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretch that I am, whither shall I go?&nbsp; Here sit I
in Venice, and what would it avail to wander further?&nbsp; What
will become of me?&nbsp; All now slumber, save myself! the Doge
rests on his couch of down; the beggar&rsquo;s head presses his
straw pillow; but for <i>me</i> there is no bed except the cold,
damp earth!&nbsp; There is no gondolier so wretched but he knows
where to find work by day and shelter by night&mdash;while
<i>I</i>&mdash;while <i>I</i>&mdash;Oh! dreadful is the destiny
of which I am made the sport!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to examine for the twentieth time the pockets of his
tattered garments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! not one paolo, by heavens!&mdash;and I hunger
almost to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He unsheathed his sword; he waved it in the moonshine, and
sighed, as he marked the glittering of the steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, my old true companion, thou and I must never
part.&nbsp; Mine thou shalt remain, though I starve for it.&nbsp;
Oh, was not that a golden time when Valeria gave thee to me, and
when she threw the belt over my shoulder, I kissed thee and
Valeria?&nbsp; She has deserted us for another world, but thou
and I will never part in this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wiped away a drop which hung upon his eyelid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! &rsquo;twas not a tear; the night wind is sharp
and bitter, and makes the eyes water; but as for
<i>tears</i>&mdash;Absurd! my weeping days are over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as he spoke, the unfortunate (for such by his discourse
and situation he appeared to be) dashed his forehead against the
earth, and his lips were already unclosed to curse the hour which
gave him being, when he seemed suddenly to recollect
himself.&nbsp; He rested his head on his elbow, and sang
mournfully the burthen of a song which had often delighted his
childhood in the castle of his ancestors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;were I to sink
under the weight of my destiny, I should be myself no
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment he heard a rustling at no great distance.&nbsp;
He looked around, and in an adjacent street, which the moon
faintly enlightened, he perceived a tall figure, wrapped in a
cloak, pacing slowly backwards and forwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the hand of God which hath guided him
hither&mdash;yes&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
<i>beg</i>&mdash;better to play the beggar in Venice than the
villain in Naples; for the beggar&rsquo;s heart may beat nobly,
though covered with rags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then sprang from the ground, and hastened towards the
adjoining street.&nbsp; Just as he entered it at one end, he
perceived another person advancing through the other, of whose
approach the first was no sooner aware than he hastily retired
into the shadow of a piazza, anxious to conceal himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can this mean?&rdquo; thought our mendicant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is yon eavesdropper one of death&rsquo;s unlicensed
ministers?&nbsp; Has he received the retaining fee of some
impatient heir, who pants to possess the wealth of the unlucky
knave who comes strolling along yonder, so careless and
unconscious?&nbsp; Be not so confident, honest friend!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m at your elbow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He retired further into the shade, and silently and slowly
drew near the lurker, who stirred not from his place.&nbsp; The
stranger had already passed them by, when the concealed villain
sprang suddenly upon him, raised his right hand in which a
poniard was gleaming, and before he could give the blow, was
felled to the earth by the arm of the mendicant.</p>
<p>The stranger turned hastily towards them; the bravo started up
and fled; the beggar smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How now?&rdquo; cried the stranger; &ldquo;what does
all this mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;tis a mere jest, signor, which has only
preserved your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? my life?&nbsp; How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The honest gentleman who has just taken to his heels
stole behind you with true cat-like caution, and had already
raised his dagger, when I saw him.&nbsp; You owe your life to me,
and the service is richly worth one little piece of money!&nbsp;
Give me some alms, signor, for on my soul I am hungry, thirsty,
cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hence, scurvy companion!&nbsp; I know you and your
tricks too well.&nbsp; This is all a concerted scheme between
you, a design upon my purse, an attempt to procure both money and
thanks, and under the lame pretence of having saved me from an
assassin.&nbsp; Go, fellow, go! practise these dainty devices on
the Doge&rsquo;s credulity if you will; but with Buonarotti you
stand no chance, believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wretched starving beggar stood like one petrified, and
gazed on the taunting stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, as I have a soul to save, signor, &rsquo;tis no lie
I tell you!&mdash;&rsquo;tis the plain truth; have compassion, or
I die this night of hunger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begone this instant, I say, or by
Heaven&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unfeeling man here drew out a concealed pistol, and
pointed it at his preserver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merciful Heaven! and is it thus that services are
acknowledged in Venice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The watch is at no great distance, I need only raise my
voice and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell and confusion! do you take me for a robber,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make no noise, I tell you.&nbsp; Be quiet&mdash;you had
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark you, signor.&nbsp; Buonarotti is your name, I
think?&nbsp; I will write it down as belonging to the second
scoundrel with whom I have met in Venice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused for a moment, then continuing in a dreadful voice,
&ldquo;And when,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou, Buonarotti, shalt
hereafter hear the name of
<i>Abellino</i>&mdash;<i>tremble</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abellino turned away, and left the hard-hearted Venetian.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE BANDITTI.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now rushed the unfortunate
wildly through the streets of Venice.&nbsp; He railed at fortune;
he laughed and cursed by turns; yet sometimes he suddenly stood
still, seemed as pondering on some great and wondrous enterprise,
and then again rushed onwards, as if hastening to its
execution.</p>
<p>Propped against a column of the Signoria, he counted over the
whole sum of his misfortunes.&nbsp; His wandering eyeballs
appeared to seek comfort, but they found it not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fate,&rdquo; he at length exclaimed in a paroxysm of
despair, &ldquo;Fate has condemned me to be either the wildest of
adventurers, or one at the relation of whose crimes the world
must shudder.&nbsp; To astonish is my destiny.&nbsp; Rosalvo can
know no medium; Rosalvo can never act like common men.&nbsp; Is
it not the hand of fate which has led me hither?&nbsp; Who could
ever have dreamt that the son of the richest lord in Naples
should have depended for a beggar&rsquo;s alms on Venetian
charity?&nbsp; I&mdash;I, who feel myself possessed of strength
of body and energy of soul fit for executing the most daring
deeds, behold me creeping in rags through the streets of this
inhospitable city, and torturing my wits in vain to discover some
means by which I may rescue life from the jaws of famine!&nbsp;
Those men whom my munificence nourished, who at my table bathed
their worthless souls in the choicest wines of Cyprus, and
glutted themselves with every delicacy which the globe&rsquo;s
four quarters could supply, these very men now deny to my
necessity even a miserable crust of mouldy bread.&nbsp; Oh, that
is dreadful, cruel&mdash;cruel of men&mdash;cruel of
Heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, folded his arms, and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet will I bear it&mdash;I will submit to my
destiny.&nbsp; I will traverse every path and go through every
degree of human wretchedness; and whate&rsquo;er may be my fate,
I will still be myself; and whate&rsquo;er may be my fate, I will
still act greatly!&nbsp; Away, then, with the Count Rosalvo, whom
all Naples idolised; now&mdash;now, I am the beggar
Abellino.&nbsp; A beggar&mdash;that name stands last in the scale
of worldly rank, but first in the list of the famishing, the
outcast, and the unworthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something rustled near him.&nbsp; Abellino gazed around.&nbsp;
He was aware of the bravo, whom he struck to the ground that
night, and whom two companions of a similar stamp had now
joined.&nbsp; As they advanced, they cast inquiring glances
around them.&nbsp; They were in search of some one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is of me that they are in search,&rdquo; said
Abellino; then advanced a few steps, and whistled.</p>
<p>The ruffians stood still; they whispered together, and seemed
to be undecided.</p>
<p>Abellino whistled a second time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis he,&rdquo; he could hear one of them say
distinctly, and in a moment after they advanced slowly towards
him.</p>
<p>Abellino kept his place, but unsheathed his sword.&nbsp; The
three unknown (they were masked) stopped a few paces from
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How now, fellow!&rdquo; quoth one of them; &ldquo;what
is the matter?&nbsp; Why stand you on your guard?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;It is as well that you should be made
to keep your distance, for I know you; you are certain honest
gentlemen, who live by taking away the lives of others.</p>
<p><i>The First Ruffian</i>.&mdash;Was not your whistling
addressed to us?</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;It was.</p>
<p><i>A Ruffian</i>.&mdash;And what would you with us?</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;Hear me!&nbsp; I am a miserable wretch,
and starving; give me an alms out of your booty!</p>
<p><i>A Ruffian</i>.&mdash;An alms?&nbsp; Ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; By my
soul that is whimsical!&mdash;Alms from us, indeed!&mdash;Oh, by
all means!&nbsp; No doubt, you shall have alms in plenty.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;Or else give me fifty sequins, and
I&rsquo;ll bind myself to your service till I shall have worked
out my debt.</p>
<p><i>A Ruffian</i>.&mdash;Aye? and pray, then, who may you
be?</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;A starving wretch, the Republic holds
none more miserable.&nbsp; Such am I at present; but
hereafter&mdash;I have powers, knaves.&nbsp; This arm could
pierce a heart, though guarded by three breastplates; this eye,
though surrounded by Egyptian darkness, could still see to stab
sure.</p>
<p><i>A Ruffian</i>.&mdash;Why, then, did you strike me down,
even now?</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;In the hope of being paid for it; but
though I saved his life, the scoundrel gave me not a single
ducat.</p>
<p><i>A Ruffian</i>.&mdash;No?&nbsp; So much the better.&nbsp;
But hark ye, comrade, are you sincere?</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;Despair never lies.</p>
<p><i>A Ruffian</i>.&mdash;Slave, shouldst thou be a
traitor&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;My heart would be within reach of your
hands, and your daggers would be as sharp as now.</p>
<p>The three dangerous companions again whispered among
themselves for a few moments, after which they returned their
daggers into the sheath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; said one of them, &ldquo;follow
us to our home.&nbsp; It were unwise to talk over certain matters
in the open streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I follow you,&rdquo; was Abellino&rsquo;s answer,
&ldquo;but tremble should any one of you dare to treat me as a
foe.&nbsp; Comrade, forgive me that I gave your ribs somewhat too
hard a squeeze just now; I will be your sworn brother in
recompense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are on honour,&rdquo; cried the banditti with one
voice; &ldquo;no harm shall happen to you.&nbsp; He who does you
an injury shall be to us as a foe.&nbsp; A fellow of your humour
suits us well; follow us, and fear not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And on they went, Abellino marching between two of them.&nbsp;
Frequent were the looks of suspicion which he cast around him;
but no ill design was perceptible in the banditti.&nbsp; They
guided him onwards, till they reached a canal, loosened a
gondola, placed themselves in it, and rowed till they had gained
the most remote quarter of Venice.&nbsp; They landed, threaded
several by-streets, and at length knocked at the door of a house
of inviting appearance.&nbsp; It was opened by a young woman, who
conducted them into a plain but comfortable chamber.&nbsp; Many
were the looks of surprise and inquiry which she cast on the
bewildered, half-pleased, half-anxious Abellino, who knew not
whither he had been conveyed, and still thought it unsafe to
confide entirely in the promises of the banditti.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE TRIAL OF STRENGTH.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Scarcely</span> were the bravoes seated,
when Cinthia (for that was the young woman&rsquo;s name) was
again summoned to the door; and the company was now increased by
two new-comers, who examined their unknown guest from head to
foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; cried one of these, who had conducted
Abellino to this respectable society, &ldquo;let us see what you
are like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this he raised a burning lamp from the table, and
the light of its flame was thrown full upon Abellino&rsquo;s
countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, forgive me my sins!&rdquo; screamed Cinthia;
&ldquo;out upon him! what an ugly hound it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned hastily round, and hid her face with her
hands.&nbsp; Dreadful was the look with which Abellino repaid her
compliment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knave,&rdquo; said one of the banditti,
&ldquo;Nature&rsquo;s own hand has marked you out for an
assassin&mdash;come, prithee be frank, and tell us how thou hast
contrived so long to escape the gibbet?&nbsp; In what gaol didst
thou leave thy last fetters?&nbsp; Or from what galley hast thou
taken thy departure, without staying to say adieu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abellino, folding his arms&mdash;&ldquo;If I be such as you
describe,&rdquo; said he, with an air of authority, and in a
voice which made his hearers tremble, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis for me
all the better.&nbsp; Whate&rsquo;er may be my future mode of
life, Heaven can have no right to find fault with it, since it
was for that it formed and fitted me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The five bravoes stepped aside, and consulted together.&nbsp;
The subject of their conference is easy to be divined.&nbsp; In
the meanwhile Abellino remained quiet and indifferent to what was
passing.</p>
<p>After a few minutes they again approached him.&nbsp; One,
whose countenance was the most ferocious, and whose form
exhibited the greatest marks of muscular strength, advanced a few
paces before the rest, and addressed Abellino as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me, comrade.&nbsp; In Venice there exist but five
banditti; you see them before you; wilt thou be the sixth?&nbsp;
Doubt not thou wilt find sufficient employment.&nbsp; My name is
Matteo, and I am the father of the band: that sturdy fellow with
the red locks is called Baluzzo; he, whose eyes twinkle like a
cat&rsquo;s, is Thomaso, an arch-knave, I promise you;
&rsquo;twas Pietrino whose bones you handled so roughly to-night;
and yon thick-lipped Colossus, who stands next to Cinthia, is
named Stuzza.&nbsp; Now, then, you know us all&mdash;and since
you are a penniless devil, we are willing to incorporate you in
our society; but we must first be assured that you mean honestly
by us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abellino smiled, or rather grinned, and murmured
hoarsely&mdash;&ldquo;I am starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer, fellow!&nbsp; Dost thou mean honestly by
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must the event decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark me, knave; the first suspicion of treachery costs
you your life.&nbsp; Take shelter in the Doge&rsquo;s palace, and
girdle yourself round with all the power of the
Republic&mdash;though clasped in the Doge&rsquo;s arms, and
protected by a hundred cannons, still would we murder you!&nbsp;
Fly to the high altar; press the crucifix to your bosom, and even
at mid-day, still would we murder you.&nbsp; Think on this well,
fellow, and forget not we are banditti!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not tell me that.&nbsp; But give me some food,
and then I&rsquo;ll prate with you as long as you please.&nbsp;
At present I am starving.&nbsp; Four-and-twenty hours have
elapsed since I last tasted nourishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cinthia now covered a small table with her best provisions,
and filled several silver goblets with delicious wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If one could but look at him without disgust,&rdquo;
murmured Cinthia; &ldquo;if he had but the appearance of
something human!&nbsp; Satan must certainly have appeared to his
mother, and thence came her child into the world with such a
frightful countenance.&nbsp; Ugh! it&rsquo;s an absolute mask,
only that I never saw a mask so hideous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abellino heeded her not; he placed himself at the table, and
ate and drank as if he would have satisfied himself for the next
six months.&nbsp; The banditti eyed him with looks of
satisfaction, and congratulated each other on such a valuable
acquisition.</p>
<p>If the reader is curious to know what this same Abellino was
like, he must picture to himself a young, stout fellow, whose
limbs perhaps might have been thought not ill-formed, had not the
most horrible countenance that ever was invented by a
caricaturist, or that Milton could have adapted to the ugliest of
his fallen angels, entirely marred the advantages of his
person.&nbsp; Black and shining, but long and straight, his hair
flew wildly about his brown neck and yellow face.&nbsp; His mouth
so wide, that his gums and discoloured teeth were visible, and a
kind of convulsive twist, which scarcely ever was at rest, had
formed its expression into an internal grin.&nbsp; His eye, for
he had but one, was sunk deep into his head, and little more than
the white of it was visible, and even that little was
overshadowed by the protrusion of his dark and bushy
eyebrow.&nbsp; In the union of his features were found collected
in one hideous assemblage all the most coarse and uncouth traits
which had ever been exhibited singly in wooden cuts, and the
observer was left in doubt whether this repulsive physiognomy
expressed stupidity of intellect, or maliciousness of heart, or
whether it implied them both together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, I am satisfied,&rdquo; roared Abellino, and
dashed the still full goblet upon the ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak!
what would you know of me?&nbsp; I am ready to give you
answers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing,&rdquo; replied Matteo, &ldquo;the
first thing necessary is to give us a proof of your strength, for
this is of material importance in our undertakings.&nbsp; Are you
good at wrestling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not; try me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cinthia removed the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, Abellino, which of us will you
undertake?&nbsp; Whom among us dost thou think that thou canst
knock down as easily as yon poor dabbler in the art,
Pietrino?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The banditti burst into a loud fit of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; cried Abellino, fiercely; &ldquo;now,
then, for the trial.&nbsp; Why come you not on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow,&rdquo; replied Matteo, &ldquo;take my advice;
try first what you can do with me alone, and learn what sort of
men you have to manage.&nbsp; Think you, we are marrowless boys,
or delicate signors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abellino answered him by a scornful laugh.&nbsp; Matteo became
furious.&nbsp; His companions shouted aloud, and clapped their
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To business!&rdquo; said Abellino; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m now
in a right humour for sport!&nbsp; Look to yourselves, my
lads.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in the same instant he collected his
forces together, threw the gigantic Matteo over his head as had
he been an infant, knocked Struzza down on the right hand, and
Pietrino on the left, tumbled Thomaso to the end of the room head
over heels, and stretched Baluzzo without animation upon the
neighbouring benches.</p>
<p>Three minutes elapsed ere the subdued bravoes could recover
themselves.&nbsp; Loudly shouted Abellino, while the astonished
Cinthia gazed and trembled at the terrible exhibition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the blood of St. Januarius!&rdquo; cried Matteo at
length, rubbing his battered joints, &ldquo;the fellow is our
master!&nbsp; Cinthia, take care to give him our best
chamber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have made a compact with the devil!&rdquo;
grumbled Thomaso, and forced his dislocated wrist back into its
socket.</p>
<p>No one seemed inclined to hazard a second trial of
strength.&nbsp; The night was far advanced, or rather the grey
morning already was visible over the sea.&nbsp; The banditti
separated, and each retired to his chamber.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE DAGGERS.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Abellino</span>, this Italian Hercules,
all terrible as he appeared to be, was not long a member of this
society before his companions felt towards him sentiments of the
most unbounded esteem.&nbsp; All loved, all valued him, for his
extraordinary talents for a bravo&rsquo;s trade, to which he
seemed peculiarly adapted, not only by his wonderful strength of
body, but by the readiness of his wit, and his never-failing
presence of mind.&nbsp; Even Cinthia was inclined to feel some
little affection for him, but&mdash;he really was too ugly.</p>
<p>Matteo, as Abellino was soon given to understand, was the
captain of this dangerous troop.&nbsp; He was one who carried
villainy to the highest pitch of refinement, incapable of fear,
quick and crafty, and troubled with less conscience than a French
financier.&nbsp; The booty and price of blood, which his
associates brought in daily, were always delivered up to him: he
gave each man his share, and retained no larger portion for
himself than was allotted to the others.&nbsp; The catalogue of
those whom he had despatched into the other world was already too
long for him to have repeated it: many names had slipped his
memory, but his greatest pleasure in his hour of relaxation was
to relate such of these murderous anecdotes as he still
remembered, in the benevolent intention of inspiring his hearers
with a desire to follow his example.&nbsp; His weapons were kept
separate from the rest, and occupied a whole apartment.&nbsp;
Here were to be found daggers of a thousand different fashions,
<i>with</i> guards and <i>without</i> them; two, three, and
four-edged.&nbsp; Here were stored air-guns, pistols, and
blunderbusses; poisons of various kinds and operating in various
ways; garments fit for every possible disguise, whether to
personate the monk, the Jew, or the mendicant; the soldier, the
sailor, or the gondolier.</p>
<p>One day he summoned Abellino to attend him in his armoury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou wilt turn out a
brave fellow, that I can see already.&nbsp; It is now time that
you should earn that bread for yourself which hitherto you have
owed to our bounty.&nbsp; Look!&nbsp; Here thou hast a dagger of
the finest steel; you must charge for its use by the inch.&nbsp;
If you plunge it only one inch deep into the bosom of his foe,
your employer must reward you with only one sequin: if two
inches, with ten sequins; if three, with twenty; if the whole
dagger, you may then name your own price.&nbsp; Here is next a
glass poniard; whomsoever this pierces, that man&rsquo;s death is
certain.&nbsp; As soon as the blow is given, you must break the
dagger in the wound.&nbsp; The flesh will close over the point
which has been broken off, and which will keep its quarters till
the day of resurrection!&nbsp; Lastly, observe this metallic
dagger; its cavity conceals a subtle poison, which, whenever you
touch this spring, will immediately infuse death into the veins
of him whom the weapon&rsquo;s point hath wounded.&nbsp; Take
these daggers.&nbsp; In giving them I present you with a capital
capable of bringing home to you most heavy and most precious
interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abellino received the instruments of death, but his hand shook
as it grasped them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possessed of such unfailing weapons, of what immense
sums must your robberies have made you master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scoundrel!&rdquo; interrupted Matteo, frowning and
offended, &ldquo;amongst us robbery is unknown.&nbsp; What?&nbsp;
Dost take us for common plunderers, for mere thieves, cut-purses,
housebreakers, and villains of that low, miserable
stamp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps what you wish me to take you for is something
worse; for, to speak openly, Matteo, villains of that stamp are
contented within plundering a purse or a casket, which can easily
be filled again; but that which we take from others is a jewel
which a man never has but once, and which stolen can never be
replaced.&nbsp; Are we not, then, a thousand times more atrocious
plunderers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the house at Loretto, I think you have a mind to
moralise, Abellino?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark ye, Matteo, only one question.&nbsp; At the Day of
Judgment, which think you will hold his head highest, the thief
or the assassin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think not that Abellino speaks thus from want of
resolution.&nbsp; Speak but the word, and I murder half the
senators of Venice; but still&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool! know, the bravo must be above crediting the
nurse&rsquo;s antiquated tales of vice and virtue.&nbsp; What is
virtue?&nbsp; What is vice?&nbsp; Nothing but such things as
forms of government, custom, manners, and education have made
sacred: and that which men are able to make honourable at one
time, it is in their power to make dishonourable at another,
whenever the humour takes them; had not the senate forbidden us
to give opinions freely respecting the politics of Venice, there
would have been nothing wrong in giving such opinions; and were
the senate to declare that it is right to give such opinions,
that which to-day is thought a crime would be thought meritorious
to-morrow.&nbsp; Then, prithee, let us have no more of such
doubts as these.&nbsp; We are men, as much as the Doge and his
senators, and have reasons as much as <i>they</i> have to lay
down the law of right and wrong, and to alter the law of right
and wrong, and to decree what shall be vice, and what shall be
virtue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abellino laughed.&nbsp; Matteo proceeded with increased
animation&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will tell me that your trade is
<i>dishonourable</i>!&nbsp; And what, then, is the thing called
<i>honour</i>!&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a word, an empty sound, a
mere fantastic creature of the imagination!&nbsp; Ask, as you
traverse some frequented street, in what honour consists?&nbsp;
The usurer will answer&mdash;&rsquo;To be honourable is to be
rich, and he has most honour who can heap up the greatest
quantity of sequins.&rsquo;&nbsp; &rsquo;By no means,&rsquo;
cries the voluptuary; &lsquo;honour consists in being beloved by
a very handsome woman, and finding no virtue proof against your
attacks.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How mistaken!&rsquo; interrupts the
general; &lsquo;to conquer whole cities, to destroy whole armies,
to ruin all provinces, <i>that</i> indeed brings <i>real</i>
honour.&rsquo;&nbsp; The man of learning places his renown in the
number of pages which he has either written or read; the tinker,
in the number of pots and kettles which he has made or mended;
the nun, in the number of <i>good</i> things which she has done,
or <i>bad</i> things which she has resisted; the coquette, in the
list of her admirers; the Republic, in the extent of her
provinces; and thus, my friend, every one thinks that honour
consists in something different from the rest.&nbsp; And why,
then, should not the bravo think that honour consists in reaching
the perfection of his trade, and in guiding a dagger to the heart
of an enemy with unerring aim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my life, &rsquo;tis a pity, Matteo, that you should
be a bravo; the schools have lost an excellent teacher of
philosophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&nbsp; Why, the fact is thus,
Abellino.&nbsp; I was educated in a monastery; my father was a
dignified prelate in Lucca, and my mother a nun of the Ursuline
order, greatly respected for her chastity and devotion.&nbsp;
Now, Signor, it was thought fitting that I should apply closely
to my studies; my father, good man, would fain have made me a
light of the Church; but I soon found that I was better qualified
for an incendiary&rsquo;s torch.&nbsp; I followed the bent of my
genius, yet count I not my studies thrown away, since they taught
me more philosophy than to tremble at phantoms created by my own
imagination.&nbsp; Follow my example, friend, and so
farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SOLITUDE.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Abellino</span> had already passed six
weeks in Venice, and yet, either from want of opportunity, or of
inclination, he had suffered his daggers to remain idle in their
sheaths.&nbsp; This proceeded partly from his not being as yet
sufficiently acquainted with the windings and turnings, the
bye-lanes and private alleys of the town, and partly because he
had hitherto found no customers, whose murderous designs stood in
need of his helping hand.</p>
<p>This want of occupation was irksome to him in the extreme; he
panted for action, and was condemned to indolence.</p>
<p>With a melancholy heart did he roam through Venice, and number
every step with a sigh.&nbsp; He frequented the public places,
the taverns, the gardens, and every scene which was dedicated to
amusement.&nbsp; But nowhere could he find what ho
sought&mdash;tranquillity.</p>
<p>One evening he had loitered beyond the other visitants in a
public garden, situated on one of the most beautiful of the
Venetian islands.&nbsp; He strolled from arbour to arbour, threw
himself down on the sea-shore, and watched the play of the waves
as they sparkled in the moonshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four years ago,&rdquo; said he, with a sigh,
&ldquo;just such a heavenly evening was it, that I stole from
Valeria&rsquo;s lips the first kiss, and heard from
Valeria&rsquo;s lips for the first time the avowal that she loved
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent, and abandoned himself to the melancholy
recollections which thronged before his mind&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>Everything around him was so calm, so silent!&nbsp; Not a
single zephyr sighed among the blades of grass; but a storm raged
in the bosom of Abellino.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four years ago could I have believed that a time would
come when I should play the part of a bravo in Venice!&nbsp; Oh,
where are they flown, the golden hopes and plans of glory which
smiled upon me in the happy days of my youth?&nbsp; I am a bravo:
to be a beggar were to be something better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When my good old father, in the enthusiasm of paternal
vanity, so oft threw his arms around my neck, and cried,
&lsquo;My boy, thou wilt render the name of Rosalvo
glorious!&rsquo;&nbsp; God, as I listened, how was my blood on
fire?&nbsp; What thought I not, what that was good and great did
I not promise myself to do!&nbsp; The father is dead, and the son
is a Venetian bravo!&nbsp; When my preceptors praised and admired
me, and, carried away by the warmth of their feelings, clapped my
shoulder, and exclaimed, &lsquo;Count, thou wilt immortalise the
ancient race of Rosalvo!&rsquo;&nbsp; Ha, in those blessed
moments of sweet delirium, how bright and beauteous stood
futurity before me!&nbsp; When, happy in the performance of some
good deed, I returned home, and saw Valeria hasten to receive me
with open arms, and when, while she clasped me to her bosom I
heard her whisper &lsquo;Oh, who could forbear to love the great
Rosalvo?&rsquo;&nbsp; God! oh, God!&nbsp; Away, away, glorious
visions of the past.&nbsp; To look on you drives me
mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was again silent; he bit his lips in fury, raised one
emaciated hand to heaven, and struck his forehead violently with
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An assassin, the slave of cowards and rascals, the ally
of the greatest villains that the Venetian sun ever shines upon,
such is now the great Rosalvo.&nbsp; Fie, ah, fie on&rsquo;t; and
yet to this wretched lot hath fatality condemned me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly he sprang from the ground after a long silence; his
eyes sparkled, his countenance was changed; he drew his breath
easier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, by Heaven, yes.&nbsp; Great as Count Rosalvo, that
can I be no longer; but from being great as a Venetian bravo,
what prevents me?&nbsp; Souls in bliss,&rdquo; he exclaimed, and
sank on his knee, while he raised his folded hands to heaven, as
if about to pronounce the most awful oath, &ldquo;Spirit of my
father; spirit of Valeria, I will not become unworthy of
you.&nbsp; Hear me, if your ghosts are permitted to wander near
me, hear me swear that the bravo shall not disgrace the origin,
nor render vain the hopes which soothed you in the bitterness of
death.&nbsp; No, sure as I live, I will be the only dealer in
this miserable trade, and posterity shall be compelled to honour
that name, which my actions shall render illustrious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed his forehead till it touched the earth, and his tears
flowed plenteously.&nbsp; Vast conceptions swelled his soul; he
dwelt on wondrous views, till their extent bewildered his brain;
yet another hour elapsed, and he sprang from the earth to realise
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will enter into no compact against human nature with
five miserable cut-throats.&nbsp; <i>Alone</i> will I make the
Republic tremble, and before eight days are flown, these
murderous knaves shall swing upon a gibbet.&nbsp; Venice shall no
longer harbour <i>five</i> banditti; <i>one</i> and <i>one</i>
only shall inhabit here, and that one shall beard the Doge
himself, shall watch over right and wrong, and according as he
judges, shall reward and punish.&nbsp; Before eight days are
flown, the State shall be purified from the presence of these
outcasts of humanity, and then shall I stand here alone.&nbsp;
Then must every villain in Venice, who hitherto has kept the
daggers of my companions in employment, have recourse to me; then
shall I know the names and persons of all those cowardly
murderers, of all those illustrious profligates, with whom Matteo
and his companions carry on the trade of blood.&nbsp; And
then&mdash;Abellino!&nbsp; Abellino, that is the name.&nbsp; Hear
it, Venice, hear it, and tremble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Intoxicated with the wildness of his hopes, he rushed out of
the garden.&nbsp; He summoned a gondolier, threw himself into the
boat, and hastened to the dwelling of Cinthia, where the
inhabitants already were folded in the arms of sleep.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ROSABELLA, THE DOGE&rsquo;S LOVELY
NIECE.</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Hark</span>, comrade,&rdquo; said
Matteo the next morning to Abellino; &ldquo;to-day thou shalt
make thy first step in our profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day!&rdquo; hoarsely murmured Abellino; &ldquo;and
on whom am I to show my skill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, to say truth, &rsquo;tis but a woman; but one must
not give too difficult a task to a young beginner.&nbsp; I will
myself accompany you, and see how you conduct yourself in the
first trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; said Abellino, and measured Matteo with his
eye from head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day, about four o&rsquo;clock, thou shalt follow me
to Dolabella&rsquo;s gardens, which are situated on the south
side of Venice.&nbsp; We must both be disguised, you
understand.&nbsp; In these gardens are excellent baths; and after
using the baths, the Doge&rsquo;s niece, the lovely Rosabella of
Corfu, frequently walks without attendants.&nbsp; And
then&mdash;you conceive me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will accompany me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be a spectator of your first adventure;
&rsquo;tis thus I deal by every one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how many inches deep must I plunge my
dagger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the hilt, boy, to the very hilt!&nbsp; Her death is
required, and the payment will be princely; Rosabella in the
grave, we are rich for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every other point was soon adjusted.&nbsp; Noon was now past,
the clock in the neighbouring church of the Benedictines struck
four, and Mattes and Abellino were already forth.&nbsp; They
arrived at the gardens of Dolabella, which that day were
unusually crowded.&nbsp; Every shady avenue was thronged with
people of both sexes; every arbour was occupied by persons most
distinguished in Venice.&nbsp; In every corner sighed lovesick
couples, as they waited for the wished approach of twilight; and
on every side did strains of vocal and instrumental music pour
their harmony on the enchanted ear.</p>
<p>Abellino mingled with the crowd.&nbsp; A most respectable
looking peruke concealed the repulsive ugliness of his features;
he imitated the walk and manners of a gouty old man, and
supported himself by a crutch, as he walked slowly through the
assembly.&nbsp; His habit, richly embroidered, procured for him
universally a good reception, and no one scrupled to enter into
conversation with him respecting the weather, the commerce of the
Republic, or the designs of its enemies; and on none of these
subjects was Abellino found incapable of sustaining the
discourse.</p>
<p>By these means he soon contrived to gain intelligence that
Rosabella was certainly in the gardens, how she was habited, and
in what quarter he was most likely to find her.</p>
<p>Thither he immediately bent his course; and hard at his heels
followed Matteo.</p>
<p>Alone, and in the most retired arbour, sat Rosabella of Corfu,
the fairest maid in Venice.</p>
<p>Abellino drew near the arbour; he tottered, as he passed its
entrance, like one oppressed with sudden faintness, and attracted
Rosabella&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, alas!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;is there no one at
hand who will take compassion on the infirmity of a poor old
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doge&rsquo;s fair niece quitted the arbour hastily, and
flew to give assistance to the sufferer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you, my good father?&rdquo; she inquired in a
melodious voice, and with a look of benevolent anxiety.</p>
<p>Abellino pointed towards the arbour; Rosabella led him in, and
placed him on a seat of turf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God reward you, lady,&rdquo; stammered Abellino,
faintly.&nbsp; He raised his eyes; they met Rosabella&rsquo;s,
and a blush crimsoned her pale cheeks.</p>
<p>Rosabella stood in silence before the disguised assassin, and
trembled with tender concern for the old man&rsquo;s illness; and
oh, that expression of interest ever makes a lovely women look so
much more lovely!&nbsp; She bent her delicate form over the man
who was bribed to murder her, and after a while asked him, in
gentlest tone, &ldquo;Are you not better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better?&rdquo; stammered the deceiver, with a feeble
voice, &ldquo;better&mdash;oh, yes, yes, yes.&nbsp; You&mdash;you
are the Doge&rsquo;s niece&mdash;the noble Rosabella of
Corfu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same, my good old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, lady, I have somewhat to tell you.&nbsp; Be on your
guard, Start not!&nbsp; What I would say is of the utmost
consequence, and demands the utmost prudence.&nbsp; Ah, God, that
there should live men so cruel!&nbsp; Lady, your life is in
danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maiden started back; the colour fled from her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to behold your assassin?&nbsp; You shall
not die, but if you value your life, be silent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosabella knew not what to think; the presence of the old man
terrified her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear nothing, lady, fear nothing; you have nothing to
fear, while I am with you.&nbsp; Before you quit this arbour you
shall see the assassin expire at your feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosabella made a movement as if she would have fled; but
suddenly the person who sat beside her was no longer an infirm
old man.&nbsp; He who a minute before had scarcely strength to
mutter out a few sentences, and reclined against the arbour
trembling like an aspen, sprang up with the force of a giant, and
drew her back with one arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the love of heaven!&rdquo; she cried,
&ldquo;release me.&nbsp; Let me fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady, fear nothing; <i>I</i> protect you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This said, Abellino placed a whistle at his lips, and blew it
shrilly.</p>
<p>Instantly sprang Matteo from his concealment in a neighbouring
clump of trees, and rushed into the arbour.&nbsp; Abellino threw
Rosabella on the bank of turf, advanced a few steps to meet
Matteo, and plunged his dagger in his heart.</p>
<p>Without uttering a single cry, sank the banditti captain at
the feet of Abellino: the death-rattle was heard in his throat,
and after a few horrible convulsions all was over.</p>
<p>Now did Matteo&rsquo;s murderer look again towards the arbour,
and beheld Rosabella half senseless, as she lay on the bank of
turf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your life is safe, beautiful Rosabella,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;there lies the villain bleeding, who conducted me hither
to murder you.&nbsp; Recover yourself; return to your uncle, the
Doge, and tell him that you owe your life to Abellino.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosabella could not speak.&nbsp; Trembling, she stretched her
arms towards him, grasped his hand, and pressed it to her lips in
silent gratitude.</p>
<p>Abellino gazed with delight and wonder on the lovely sufferer;
and in such a situation, who could have beheld her without
emotion?&nbsp; Rosabella had scarcely numbered seventeen summers;
her light and delicate limbs, enveloped in a thin white garment,
which fell around her in a thousand folds; her blue and melting
eyes, whence beamed the expression of purest innocence; her
forehead, white as ivory, overshadowed the ringlets of her bright
dark hair; cheeks, whence terror had now stolen the roses; such
was Rosabella, a creature in whose formation partial Nature
seemed to have omitted nothing which might constitute the
perfection of female loveliness&mdash;such was she; and being
such, the wretched Abellino may be forgiven if for some few
minutes he stood like one enchanted, and bartered for those few
minutes the tranquillity of his heart for ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Him who made me,&rdquo; cried he at length,
&ldquo;oh! thou art fair, Rosabella; Valeria was not
fairer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed himself down to her, and imprinted a burning kiss on
the pale cheeks of the beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me, thou dreadful man,&rdquo; she stammered in
terror; &ldquo;oh, leave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Rosabella, why art thou so beauteous, and why am
I&mdash;Knowest thou who kissed thy cheek, Rosabella?&nbsp; Go,
tell thy uncle, the proud Doge&mdash;<i>&rsquo;Twas the
bravo</i>, <i>Abellino</i>,&rdquo; he said, and rushed out of the
arbour.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE BRAVO&rsquo;S BRIDE.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not without good reason that
Abellino took his departure in such haste.&nbsp; He had quitted
the spot but a few minutes, when a large party accidentally
strolled that way, and discovered with astonishment the corpse of
Matteo, and Rosabella pale and trembling in the arbour.</p>
<p>A crowd immediately collected itself round them.&nbsp; It
increased with every moment, and Rosabella was necessitated to
repeat what had happened to her for the satisfaction of every
newcomer.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile some of the Doge&rsquo;s courtiers, who
happened to be among the crowd, hastened to call her attendants
together; her gondola was already waiting for her, and the
terrified girl soon reached her uncle&rsquo;s palace in
safety.</p>
<p>In vain was an embargo laid upon every other gondola; in vain
did they examine every person who was in the gardens of Dolabella
at the time, when the murdered assassin was first
discovered.&nbsp; No traces could be found of Abellino.</p>
<p>The report of this strange adventure spread like wildfire
through Venice.&nbsp; Abellino, for Rosabella had preserved but
too well in her memory that dreadful name, and by the relation of
her danger had given it universal publicity, Abellino was the
object of general wonder and curiosity.&nbsp; Every one pitied
the poor Rosabella for what she had suffered, execrated the
villain who had bribed Matteo to murder her, and endeavoured to
connect the different circumstances together by the help of one
hypothesis or other, among which it would have been difficult to
decide which was the most improbable.</p>
<p>Every one who heard the adventure, told it again, and every
one who told it, added something of his own, till at length it
was made into a complete romantic novel, which might have been
entitled with great propriety, &ldquo;The Power of Beauty;&rdquo;
for the Venetian gentlemen and ladies had settled the point among
themselves completely to their own satisfaction, that Abellino
would undoubtedly have assassinated Rosabella, had he not been
prevented by her uncommon beauty.&nbsp; But though
Abellino&rsquo;s interference had preserved her life, it was
doubted much whether this adventure would be at all relished by
her destined bridegroom, the Prince of Monaldeschi, a Neapolitan
of the first rank, possessed of immense wealth and extensive
influence.&nbsp; The Doge had for some time been secretly engaged
in negotiating a match between his niece and this powerful
nobleman, who was soon expected to make his appearance at
Venice.&nbsp; The motive of his journey, in spite of all the
Doge&rsquo;s precautions, had been divulged, and it was no longer
a secret to any but Rosabella, who had never seen the prince, and
could not imagine why his expected visit should excite such
general curiosity.</p>
<p>Thus far the story had been told much to Rosabella&rsquo;s
credit; but at length the women began to envy her for her share
in the adventure.&nbsp; The kiss which she had received from the
bravo afforded them an excellent opportunity for throwing out a
few malicious insinuations.&nbsp; &ldquo;She received a great
service,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s no saying how
far the fair Rosabella in the warmth of gratitude may have been
carried in rewarding her preserver.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very
true,&rdquo; observed another, &ldquo;and for my part, I think it
not very likely that the fellow, being alone with a pretty girl,
whose life he had just saved, should have gone away contented
with a single kiss.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo;
interrupted a third, &ldquo;do not let us judge uncharitably; the
fact may be exactly as the lady relates it, though I <i>must</i>
say, that gentlemen of Abellino&rsquo;s profession are not
usually so pretty-behaved, and that this is the first time I ever
heard of a bravo in the Platonics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In short, Rosabella and the horrible Abellino furnished the
indolent and gossiping Venetians with conversation so long, that
at length the Doge&rsquo;s niece was universally known by the
honourable appellation of the &ldquo;Bravo&rsquo;s
Bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no one gave himself more trouble about this affair than
the Doge, the good but proud Andreas.&nbsp; He immediately issued
orders that every person of suspicious appearance should be
watched more closely than ever, the night patrols were doubled,
and spies were employed daily in procuring intelligence of
Abellino; and yet all was in vain.&nbsp; Abellino&rsquo;s retreat
was inscrutable.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE CONSPIRACY.</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Confusion</span>!&rdquo; exclaimed
Parozzi, a Venetian nobleman of the first rank, as he paced his
chamber with a disordered air on the morning after Matteo&rsquo;s
murder; &ldquo;now all curses light upon the villain&rsquo;s
awkwardness; yet it seems inconceivable to me how all this should
have fallen out so untowardly.&nbsp; Has any one discovered my
designs?&nbsp; I know well that Verrino loves Rosabella.&nbsp;
Was it he who opposed this confounded Abellino to Matteo, and
charged him to mar my plans against her?&nbsp; That seems likely;
and now, when the Doge inquires who it was that employed
assassins to murder his niece, what other will be suspected than
Parozzi, the discontented lover, to whom Rosabella refused her
hand, and whom Andreas hates past hope of reconciliation?&nbsp;
And now, having once found the scent&mdash;Parozzi!&nbsp;
Parozzi! should the crafty Andreas get an insight into your
plans, should he learn that you have placed yourself at the head
of a troop of hare-brained youths&mdash;hare-brained may I well
call children&mdash;who, in order to avoid the rod, set fire to
their paternal mansions.&nbsp; Parozzi, should all this be
revealed to Andreas&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here his reflections were interrupted.&nbsp; Memmo, Falieri,
and Contarino entered the room, three young Venetians of the
highest rank, Parozzi&rsquo;s inseparable companions, men
depraved both in mind and body, spendthrifts, voluptuaries, well
known to every usurer in Venice, and owing more than their
paternal inheritance would ever admit of their paying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how is this, Parozzi?&rdquo; cried Memmo as he
entered, a wretch whose every feature exhibited marks of that
libertinism to which his life had been dedicated; &ldquo;I can
scarce recover myself from my astonishment.&nbsp; For
Heaven&rsquo;s sake, is this report true?&nbsp; Did you really
hire Matteo to murder the Doge&rsquo;s niece?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; exclaimed Parozzi, and hastily turned away to
hide the deadly paleness which overspread his countenance;
&ldquo;why should you suppose that any such designs&mdash;surely,
Memmo, you are distracted.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;By my soul, I speak but the plain matter
of fact.&nbsp; Nay, only ask Falieri; he can tell you more.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Faith, it is certain, Parozzi, that
Lomellino has declared to the Doge as a truth beyond doubting
that you, and none but you, were the person who instigated Matteo
to attempt Rosabella&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;And I tell you again that Lomellino
knows not what he says.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Well, well, only be upon your
guard.&nbsp; Andreas is a terrible fellow to deal with.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;<i>He</i> terrible.&nbsp; I tell you he
is the most contemptible blockhead that the universe can
furnish!&nbsp; Courage perhaps he possesses, but of brains not an
atom.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;And <i>I</i> tell you that Andreas is
as brave as a lion, and as crafty as a fox.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Pshaw! pshaw!&nbsp; Everything would go
to rack and ruin were it not for the wiser heads of this
triumvirate of counsellors, whom Heaven confound!&nbsp; Deprive
him of Paolo Manfrone, Conari, and Lomellino, and the Doge would
stand there looking as foolish as a schoolboy who was going to be
examined and had forgotten his lesson.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Falieri is in the right.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;Quite, quite.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;And then Andreas is as proud as a beggar
grown rich and dressed in his first suit of embroidery.&nbsp; By
St. Anthony, he is become quite insupportable.&nbsp; Do you not
observe how he increases the number of his attendants daily?</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;Nay, that is an undoubted fact.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;And then, to what an unbounded extent
has he carried his influence.&nbsp; The Signoria, the Quaranti,
the Procurators of St. Mark, the Avocatori, all think and act
exactly as it suits the Doge&rsquo;s pleasure and
convenience!&nbsp; Every soul of them depends as much on that one
man&rsquo;s honour and caprices as puppets do who nod or shake
their wooden heads just as the fellow behind the curtain thinks
proper to move the wires.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;And yet the populace idolises this
Andreas.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;Ay, that is the worst part of the
story.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;But never credit me again if he does not
experience a reverse of fortune speedily.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;That might happen would we but set our
shoulders to the wheel stoutly.&nbsp; But what do we do?&nbsp; We
pass our time in taverns; drink and game, and throw ourselves
headlong into such an ocean of debts, that the best swimmer must
sink at last.&nbsp; Let us resolve to make the attempt.&nbsp; Let
us seek recruits on all sides; let us labour with all our might
and main.&nbsp; Things must change, or if they do not, take my
word for it, my friends, this world is no longer a world for
us.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;Nay, it&rsquo;s a melancholy truth, that
during the last half-year my creditors have been ready to beat my
door down with knocking.&nbsp; I am awakened out of my sleep in
the morning, and lulled to rest again at night with no other
music than their eternal clamour.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; As for me, I need not
tell you how I am suited.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Had we been less extravagant, we might
at this moment have been sitting quietly in our palaces; but as
things stand now&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Well, as things stand now&mdash;I verily
believe that Falieri is going to moralise.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;That is ever the way with old sinners
when they have lost the power to sin any longer.&nbsp; Then they
are ready enough to weep over their past life, and talk loudly
about repentance and reformation.&nbsp; Now, for my own part, I
am perfectly well satisfied with my wanderings from the common
beaten paths of morality and prudence.&nbsp; They serve to
convince me that I am not one of your every-day men, who sit
cramped up in the chimney-corner, lifeless, phlegmatic, and
shudder when they hear of any extraordinary occurrence.&nbsp;
Nature evidently has intended me to be a libertine, and I am
determined to fulfil my destination.&nbsp; Why, if spirits like
ours were not produced every now and then, the world would
absolutely go fast asleep, but we rouse it by deranging the old
order of things, force mankind to quicken their snail&rsquo;s
pace, furnish a million of idlers with riddles which they puzzle
their brains about without being able to comprehend, infuse some
hundreds of new ideas into the heads of the great multitude, and,
in short, are as useful to the world as tempests are, which
dissipate those exhalations with which Nature otherwise would
poison herself.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Excellent sophistry, by my honour.&nbsp;
Why, Contarino, ancient Rome has had an irreparable loss in not
having numbered you among her orators.&nbsp; It is a pity,
though, that there should be so little that&rsquo;s solid wrapped
up in so many fine-sounding words.&nbsp; Now learn that while
you, with this rare talent of eloquence, have been most
unmercifully wearing out the patience of your good-natured
hearers, Falieri has been in <i>action</i>.&nbsp; The Cardinal
Gonzaga is discontented with the government&mdash;Heaven knows
what Andreas has done to make him so vehemently his
enemy&mdash;but, in short, Gonzaga now belongs to our party.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i> (with astonishment and delight).&mdash;Falieri,
are you in your senses?&nbsp; The Cardinal Gonzaga&mdash;?</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Is ours, and ours both body and
soul.&nbsp; I confess I was first obliged to rhodomontade a good
deal to him about our patriotism, our glorious designs, our love
for freedom, and so forth; in short, Gonzaga is a hypocrite, and
therefore is Gonzaga the fitter for us.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i> (clasping Falieri&rsquo;s hand).&mdash;Bravo,
my friend!&nbsp; Venice shall see a second edition of
Catiline&rsquo;s conspiracy.&nbsp; Now, then, it is <i>my</i>
turn to speak, for I have not been idle since we parted.&nbsp; In
truth, I have as yet <i>caught</i> nothing, but I have made
myself master of an all-powerful net, with which I doubt not to
capture the best half of Venice.&nbsp; You all know the
Marchioness Olympia?</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Does not each of us keep a list of the
handsomest women in the Republic, and can we have forgotten
number one?</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Olympia and Rosabella are the goddesses
of Venice; our youths burn incense on no other altars.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Olympia is my own.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;How?</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Olympia?</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Why, how now?&nbsp; Why stare ye as
had I prophesied to you that the skies were going to fall?&nbsp;
I tell you Olympia&rsquo;s heart is mine, and that I possess her
entire and most intimate confidence.&nbsp; Our connection must
remain a profound secret, but depend on it, whatever <i>I</i>
wish <i>she</i> wishes also; and you know she can make half the
nobility in Venice dance to the sound of her pipe, let her play
what tune she pleases.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Contarino, you are our master.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;And you had not the least suspicion
how powerful an ally I was labouring to procure for you?</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;I must blush for myself while I listen
to you, since as yet I have done nothing.&nbsp; Yet this I must
say in my excuse: Had Matteo, bribed by my gold, accomplished
Rosabella&rsquo;s murder, the Doge would have been robbed of that
chain with which he holds the chief men in Venice attached to his
government.&nbsp; Andreas would have no merit, were Rosabella
once removed.&nbsp; The most illustrious families would care no
longer for his friendship with their hopes of a connection with
him by means of his niece buried in her grave.&nbsp; Rosabella
will one day be the Doge&rsquo;s heiress.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;All that I can do for you in this business
is to provide you with pecuniary supplies.&nbsp; My old miserable
uncle, whose whole property becomes mine at his death, has
brimful coffers, and the old miser dies whenever I say the
word.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;You have suffered him to live too long
already.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;Why, I never have been able to make up my
mind entirely to&mdash;You would scarcely believe it, friends,
but at times I am so hypochondriac, that I could almost fancy I
feel twinges of conscience.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Indeed.&nbsp; Then take my advice, go
into a monastery.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;Our care first must be to find out our old
acquaintances, Matteo&rsquo;s companions: yet, having hitherto
always transacted business with them through their captain, I
know not where they are to be met with.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;As soon as they are found, their first
employment must be the removal of the Doge&rsquo;s trio of
advisers.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;That were an excellent idea, if it
were as easily done as said.&nbsp; Well, then, my friends, this
principal point at least is decided.&nbsp; Either we will bury
our debts under the ruins of the existing constitution of the
Republic, or make Andreas a gift of our heads towards
strengthening the walls of the building.&nbsp; In either case, we
shall at least obtain quiet.&nbsp; Necessity, with her whip of
serpents, has driven us to the very highest point of her rock,
whence we must save ourselves by some act of extraordinary
daring, or be precipitated on the opposite side into the abyss of
shame and eternal oblivion.&nbsp; The next point to be considered
is, how we may best obtain supplies for our necessary expenses,
and induce others to join with us in our plans.&nbsp; For this
purpose we must use every artifice to secure in our interests the
courtesans of the greatest celebrity in Venice.&nbsp; What
<i>we</i> should be unable to effect by every power of
persuasion, banditti by their daggers, and princes by their
treasuries, can one of those Phrynes accomplish with a single
look.&nbsp; Where the terrors of the scaffold are without effect,
and the exhortations of the priests are heard with coldness, a
wanton look and a tender promise often perform wonders.&nbsp; The
bell which sounded the hour of assignation has often rang the
knell of the most sacred principles and most steadfast
resolutions.&nbsp; But should you either fail to gain the mastery
over the minds of these women, or fear to be yourselves entangled
in the nets which you wish to spread for others, in these cases
you must have recourse to the holy father confessors.&nbsp;
Flatter the pride of these insolent friars; paint for them upon
the blank leaf of futurity bishops&rsquo; mitres, patriarchal
missions, the hats of cardinals, and the keys of St. Peter; my
life upon it, they will spring at the bait, and you will have
them completely at your disposal.&nbsp; These hypocrites who
govern the consciences of the bigoted Venetians, hold man and
woman, the noble and the mendicant, the Doge and the gondolier,
bound fast in the chains of superstition, by which they can head
them wheresoever it best suits their pleasure.&nbsp; It will save
us tons of gold in gaining over proselytes, and keeping their
consciences quiet when gained, if we can but obtain the
assistance of the confessors, whose blessings and curses pass
with the multitude for current coin.&nbsp; Now, then, to work,
comrades, and so farewell.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CINTHIA&rsquo;S DWELLING.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Scarcely</span> had Abellino achieved the
bloody deed which employed every tongue in Venice, when he
changed his dress and whole appearance with so much expedition
and success as to prevent the slightest suspicion of his being
Matteo&rsquo;s murderer.&nbsp; He quitted the gardens
unquestioned, nor left the least trace which could lead to a
discovery.</p>
<p>He arrived at Cinthia&rsquo;s dwelling.&nbsp; It was already
evening.&nbsp; Cinthia opened the door, and Abellino entered the
common apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the rest?&rdquo; said he in a savage tone of
voice whose sound made Cinthia tremble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been asleep,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;since mid-day.&nbsp; Probably they mean to go out on some
pursuit to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; Abellino threw himself into a
chair, and seemed to be lost in thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why are you always so gloomy, Abellino?&rdquo; said
Cinthia, drawing near him; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s that which makes you
so ugly.&nbsp; Prithee away with those frowns; they make your
countenance look worse than nature made it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abellino gave no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, you are enough to frighten a body!&nbsp; Come,
now, let us be friends, Abellino; I begin not to dislike you, and
to endure your appearance; and I don&rsquo;t know
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, wake the sleepers!&rdquo; roared the bravo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sleepers?&nbsp; Pshaw, let them sleep on, the
stupid rogues.&nbsp; Sure you are not afraid to be alone with
me?&nbsp; Mercy on me, one would think I looked as terrible as
yourself?&nbsp; Do I?&nbsp; Nay, look on me, Abellino.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cinthia, to say the truth, was by no means an ill-looking
girl; her eyes were bright and expressive; the hair fell in
shining ringlets over her bosom; her lips were red and full, and
she bowed them towards Abellino&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But
Abellino&rsquo;s were still sacred by the touch of
Rosabella&rsquo;s cheek.&nbsp; He started from his seat, and
removed, yet gently, Cinthia&rsquo;s hand, which rested on his
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake the sleepers, my good girl,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I must speak with them this moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cinthia hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, go,&rdquo; said he, in a fierce voice.</p>
<p>Cinthia retired in silence; yet as she crossed the threshold,
she stopped for an instant and menaced him with her finger.</p>
<p>Abellino strode through the chamber with hasty steps, his head
reclining on his shoulder, his arms folded over his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first step is taken,&rdquo; said he to
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is one moral monster the less on
earth.&nbsp; I have committed no sin by this murder; I have but
performed a sacred duty.&nbsp; Aid me, thou Great and Good, for
arduous is the task before me.&nbsp; Ah, should that task be gone
through with success, and Rosabella be the reward of my
labours&mdash;Rosabella?&nbsp; What, shall the Doge&rsquo;s niece
bestow on the outcast Abellino?&nbsp; Oh, madman that I am to
hope it, never can I reach the goal of my wishes!&nbsp; No, never
was there frenzy to equal mine.&nbsp; To attach myself at first
sight to&mdash;Yet Rosabella alone is capable of thus enchanting
at first sight&mdash;Rosabella and Valeria?&nbsp; To be beloved
by two such women&mdash;Yet, though &rsquo;tis impossible to
attain, the striving to attain such an end is glorious.&nbsp;
Illusions so delightful will at least make me happy for a moment,
and alas, the wretched Abellino needs so many illusions that for
a moment will make him happy!&nbsp; Oh, surely, knew the world
what I gladly would accomplish, the world would both love and
pity me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cinthia returned; the four bravoes followed her, yawning,
grumbling, and still half asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; said Abellino, &ldquo;rouse
yourselves, lads.&nbsp; Before I say anything, be convinced that
you are wide awake, for what I am going to tell you is so strange
that you would scarce believe it in a dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They listened to him with an air of indifference and
impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; said Thomaso,
while he stretched himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither more nor less than that our honest, hearty,
brave Matteo is murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, murdered!&rdquo; every one exclaimed, and gazed
with looks of terror on the bearer of this unwelcome news; while
Cinthia gave a loud scream, and, clasping her hands together,
sank almost breathless into a chair.</p>
<p>A general silence prevailed for some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murdered!&rdquo; at length repeated Thomaso, &ldquo;and
by whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Baluzzo</i>.&mdash;Where?</p>
<p><i>Pietrino</i>.&mdash;What? this forenoon?</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;In the gardens of Dolabella, where he
was found bleeding at the feet of the Doge&rsquo;s niece.&nbsp;
Whether he fell by her hand, or by that of one of her admirers, I
cannot say.</p>
<p><i>Cinthia</i> (weeping).&mdash;Poor dear Matteo.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;About this time to-morrow you will see
his corpse exhibited on the gibbet.</p>
<p><i>Pietrino</i>.&mdash;What!&nbsp; Did any one recognise
him?</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;Yes, yes! there&rsquo;s no doubt about
his trade, you may depend on&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><i>Cinthia</i>.&mdash;The gibbet!&nbsp; Poor dear Matteo!</p>
<p><i>Thomaso</i>.&mdash;This is a fine piece of work.</p>
<p><i>Baluzzo</i>.&mdash;Confound the fellow, who would have
thought of anything happening so unlucky?</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;Why, how now?&nbsp; You seem to be
overcome.</p>
<p><i>Struzza</i>.&mdash;I cannot recover myself; surprise and
terror have almost stupefied me.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;Indeed!&nbsp; By my life, when I heard
the news I burst into laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Signor
Matteo,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I wish your worship joy of your
safe arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Thomaso</i>.&mdash;What?</p>
<p><i>Struzza</i>.&mdash;You laughed?&nbsp; Hang me if I can see
what there is to laugh at.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;Why, surely you are not afraid of
receiving what you are so ready to bestow on others?&nbsp; What
is your object?&nbsp; What can we expect as our reward at the end
of our labours except the gibbet or the rock?&nbsp; What
memorials of our actions shall we leave behind us, except our
skeletons dancing in the air, and the chains which rattle round
them?&nbsp; He who chooses to play the bravo&rsquo;s part on the
great theatre of the world must not be afraid of death, whether
it comes at the hands of the physician or the executioner.&nbsp;
Come, come, pluck up your spirits, comrades.</p>
<p><i>Thomaso</i>.&mdash;That&rsquo;s easy to say, but quite out
of my power.</p>
<p><i>Pietrino</i>.&mdash;Mercy on me, how my teeth chatter.</p>
<p><i>Baluzzo</i>.&mdash;Prithee, Abellino, be composed for a
moment or two, your gaiety at a time like this is quite
horrible.</p>
<p><i>Cinthia</i>.&mdash;Oh, me! oh, me!&nbsp; Poor murdered
Matteo.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;Hey-day.&nbsp; Why, what is all this!
Cinthia, my life, are you not ashamed of being such a
child?&nbsp; Come, let you and I renew that conversation which my
sending you to wake these gentlemen interrupted.&nbsp; Sit down
by me, sweetheart, and give me a kiss.</p>
<p><i>Cinthia</i>.&mdash;Out upon you, monster.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;What, have you altered your mind, my
pretty dear?&nbsp; Well, well, with all my heart, when <i>you</i>
are in the humour, perhaps <i>I</i> may not have the
inclination.</p>
<p><i>Baluzzo</i>.&mdash;Death and the devil, Abellino, is this a
time for talking nonsense?&nbsp; Prithee keep such trash for a
fitter occasion, and let us consider what we are to do just
now.</p>
<p><i>Pietrino</i>.&mdash;Nay, this is no season for
trifling.</p>
<p><i>Struzza</i>.&mdash;Tell us, Abellino; you are a clever
fellow; what course is it best for us to take?</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i> (after a pause).&mdash;Nothing must be done,
or a great deal.&nbsp; One of two things we must choose.&nbsp;
Either we must remain <i>where</i> we are, and <i>what</i> we
are, murder honest men to please any rascal who will give us gold
and fair words, and make up our minds to be hung, broken on the
wheel, condemned to the galleys, burnt alive, crucified, or
beheaded, at the long run, just as it may seem best to the
supreme authority; or else&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Thomaso</i>.&mdash;Or else?&nbsp; Well?</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;Or else we must divide the spoils which
are already in our possession, quit the Republic, begin a new and
better life, and endeavour to make our peace with Heaven.&nbsp;
We have already wealth enough to make it unnecessary for us to
ask how shall we get our bread?&nbsp; You may either buy an
estate in some foreign country, or keep <i>Osteria</i>, or engage
in commerce, or set up some trade, or, in short, do whatever you
like best, so that you do but abandon the profession of an
assassin.&nbsp; Then we may look out for a wife among the pretty
girls of our own rank in life, become the happy fathers of sons
and daughters may eat and drink in peace and security, and make
amends by the honesty of our future lives for the offences of our
past.</p>
<p><i>Thomaso</i>.&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;What <i>you</i> do, that will <i>I</i>
do too; I will either hang or be broken on the wheel along with
you, or become an honest man, just as you please.&nbsp; Now,
then, what is your decision?</p>
<p><i>Thomaso</i>.&mdash;Was there ever such a stupid
counsellor.</p>
<p><i>Pietrino</i>.&mdash;Our decision?&nbsp; Nay, the
point&rsquo;s not very difficult to decide.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;I should have thought it <i>had</i>
been.</p>
<p><i>Thomaso</i>.&mdash;Without more words, then, I vote for our
remaining as we are, and carrying on our old trade; that will
bring us plenty of gold, and enable us to lead a jolly life.</p>
<p><i>Pietrino</i>.&mdash;Right, lad, you speak my thoughts
exactly.</p>
<p><i>Thomaso</i>.&mdash;We are bravoes, it&rsquo;s true; but
what then?&nbsp; We are honest fellows, and the devil take him
who dares to say we are not.&nbsp; However, at any rate, we must
keep within doors for a few days, lest we should be discovered;
for I warrant you the Doge&rsquo;s spies are abroad in search of
us by this.&nbsp; But as soon as the pursuit is over, be it our
first business to find out Matteo&rsquo;s murderer, and throttle
him out of hand as a warning to all others.</p>
<p><i>All</i>.&mdash;Bravo, bravissimo.</p>
<p><i>Pietrino</i>.&mdash;And from this day forth I vote that
Thomaso should be our captain.</p>
<p><i>Struzza</i>.&mdash;Aye, in Matteo&rsquo;s stead.</p>
<p><i>All</i>.&mdash;Right, right.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;To which I say amen with all my
heart.&nbsp; Now, then, all is decided.</p>
<h2>Book the Second.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE BIRTHDAY.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> solitude and anxiety, with
barred windows and bolted doors, did the banditti pass the day
immediately succeeding Matteo&rsquo;s murder; every murmur in the
street appeared to them a cause of apprehension; every footstep
which approached their doors made them tremble till it had passed
them.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the ducal palace blazed with splendour and
resounded with mirth.&nbsp; The Doge celebrated the birthday of
his fair niece, Rosabella; and the feast was honoured by the
presence of the chief persons of the city, of the foreign
ambassadors, and of many illustrious strangers who were at that
time resident in Venice.</p>
<p>On this occasion no expense had been spared, no source of
pleasure had been neglected.&nbsp; The arts contended with each
other for superiority; the best poets in Venice celebrated this
day with powers excelling anything which they had before
exhibited, for the subject of their verses was Rosabella; the
musicians and <i>virtuosi</i> surpassed all their former
triumphs, for their object was to obtain the suffrage of
Rosabella.&nbsp; The singular union of all kinds of pleasure
intoxicated the imagination of every guest; and the genius of
delight extended his influence over the whole assembly, over the
old man and the youth, over the matron and the virgin.</p>
<p>The venerable Andreas had seldom been in such high spirits as
on this occasion.&nbsp; He was all life; smiles of satisfaction
played round his lips; gracious and condescending to every one,
he made it his chief care to prevent his rank from being
felt.&nbsp; Sometimes he trifled with the ladies, whose beauty
formed the greatest ornament of this entertainment; sometimes he
mingled among the masks, whose fantastic appearance and gaiety of
conversation enlivened the ball-room by their variety; at other
times he played chess with the generals and admirals of the
Republic; and frequently he forsook everything to gaze with
delight on Rosabella&rsquo;s dancing, or listen in silent rapture
to Rosabella&rsquo;s music.</p>
<p>Lomellino, Conari, and Paolo Manfrone, the Doge&rsquo;s three
confidential friends and counsellors, in defiance of their grey
hairs, mingled in the throng of youthful beauties, flirted first
with one and then with another, and the arrows of raillery were
darted and received on both sides with spirit and good
humour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Lomellino,&rdquo; said Andreas to his friend, who
entered the saloon in which the Doge was at that time
accidentally alone with his niece, &ldquo;you seem in gayer
spirits this evening than when we were lying before Scardona, and
had so hard a game to play against the Turks.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lomellino</i>.&mdash;I shall not take upon me to deny that,
signor.&nbsp; I still think with a mixture of terror and
satisfaction on the night when we took Scardona, and carried the
half-moon before the city walls.&nbsp; By my soul, our Venetians
fought like lions.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;Fill this goblet to their memory, my old
soldier; you have earned your rest bravely.</p>
<p><i>Lomellino</i>.&mdash;Aye, signor, and oh, it is so sweet to
rest on laurels.&nbsp; But in truth, &rsquo;tis to you that I am
indebted for mine; it is you who have immortalised me.&nbsp; No
soul on earth would have known that Lomellino existed, had he not
fought in Dalmatia and Sicilia under the banners of the great
Andreas, and assisted him in raising eternal trophies in honour
of the Republic.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;My good Lomellino, the Cyprus wine must
have heated your imagination.</p>
<p><i>Lomellino</i>.&mdash;Nay, I know well I ought not to call
you great, and praise you thus openly to your face; but faith,
signor, I am grown too old for it to be worth my while to
flatter.&nbsp; That is a business which I leave to our young
courtiers, who have never yet come within the smell of powder,
and never have fought for Venice and Andreas.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;You are an old enthusiast.&nbsp; Think
you the Emperor is of the same opinion?</p>
<p><i>Lomellino</i>.&mdash;Unless Charles the Fifth is deceived
by those about him, or is too proud to allow the greatness of an
enemy, he must say, perforce, &ldquo;There is but one man on
earth whom I fear, and who is worthy to contend with me, and that
man is Andreas.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;I suspect he will be sorely displeased
when he receives my answer to the message by which he notified to
me the imprisonment of the French king.</p>
<p><i>Lomellino</i>.&mdash;Displeased he will be, signor, no
doubt of it; but what then?&nbsp; Venice need not fear his
displeasure, while Andreas still lives.&nbsp; But when you and
your heroes are once gone to your eternal rest&mdash;then, alas
for thee, poor Venice.&nbsp; I fear your golden times will soon
come to their conclusion.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;What!&nbsp; Have we not many young
officers of great promise?</p>
<p><i>Lomellino</i>.&mdash;Alas, what are most of them?&nbsp;
Heroes in the fields of Venus.&nbsp; Heroes at a
drinking-bout.&nbsp; Effeminate striplings, relaxed both in mind
and body.&nbsp; But how am I running on, forgetful.&nbsp; Ah,
when one is grown old, and conversing with an Andreas, it is easy
to forget everything else.&nbsp; My lord, I sought you with a
request, a request, too, of consequence.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;You excite my curiosity.</p>
<p><i>Lomellino</i>.&mdash;About a week ago there arrived here a
young Florentine nobleman called Flodoardo, a youth of noble
appearance and great promise.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;Well?</p>
<p><i>Lomellino</i>.&mdash;His father was one of my dearest
friends.&nbsp; He is dead now, the good old generous
nobleman.&nbsp; In our youth we served together on board the same
vessel, and many a turbaned head has fallen beneath his
sword.&nbsp; Ah, he was a brave soldier.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;While celebrating the father&rsquo;s
bravery, you seem to have quite forgotten the son.</p>
<p><i>Lomellino</i>.&mdash;His son is arrived in Venice, and
wishes to enter into the service of the Republic.&nbsp; I entreat
you, give the young man some respectable situation; he will prove
the boast of Venice when we shall be in our graves, on that would
I hazard my existence.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;Has he sense and talent?</p>
<p><i>Lomellino</i>.&mdash;That he has; a heart like his
father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Will it please you to see and converse with
him?&nbsp; He is yonder, among the masks in the great
saloon.&nbsp; One thing I must tell you, as a specimen of his
designs.&nbsp; He has heard of the banditti who infest Venice,
and he engages that the first piece of service which he renders
the Republic shall be the delivering into the hands of justice
those concealed assassins, who hitherto have eluded the vigilance
of our police.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;Indeed!&nbsp; I doubt that promise will
be too much for his power to perform.&nbsp; Flodoardo, I think
you called him?&nbsp; Tell him I would speak with him.</p>
<p><i>Lomellino</i>.&mdash;Oh! then I have gained at least the
<i>half</i> of my cause, and I believe the <i>whole</i> of it,
for to see Flodoardo and not to like him is as difficult as to
look at Paradise and not wish to enter.&nbsp; To see Flodoardo
and to hate him is as unlikely as that a blind man should hate
the kind hand which removes the cataract from his eyes, and pours
upon them the blessings of light and beauties of nature.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i> (smiling).&mdash;In the whole course of our
acquaintance, Lomellino, never did I hear you so
enthusiastic!&nbsp; Go, then, conduct this prodigy hither.</p>
<p><i>Lomellino</i>.&mdash;I hasten to find him.&nbsp; And as for
you, signora, look to yourself! look to yourself, I say!</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i>.&mdash;Nay, prithee, Lomellino, bring your
hero hither without delay; you have raised my curiosity to the
height.</p>
<p>Lomellino quitted the saloon.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;How comes it that you rejoin not the
dancers, my child?</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i>.&mdash;I am weary, and, besides, curiosity
now detains me here, for I would fain see this Flodoardo, whom
Lomellino thinks deserving of such extraordinary praise.&nbsp;
Shall I tell you the truth, my dear uncle?&nbsp; I verily believe
that I am already acquainted with him.&nbsp; There was a mask in
a Grecian habit, whose appearance was so striking, that it was
impossible for him to remain confounded with the crowd.&nbsp; The
least attentive eye must have singled him out from among a
thousand.&nbsp; It was a tall light figure, so graceful in every
movement; then his dancing was quite perfection.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i> (smiling, and threatening with his
finger).&mdash;Child, child!</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i>.&mdash;Nay, my dear uncle, what I say is mere
justice; it is possible, indeed, that the Greek and the
Florentine may be two different persons, but still, according to
Lomellino&rsquo;s description&mdash;Oh! look, dear uncle, only
look yonder; there stands the Greek, as I live.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;And Lomellino is with him; they
approach.&nbsp; Rosabella, you have made a good guess.</p>
<p>The Doge had scarcely ceased to speak, when Lomellino entered
the room, conducting a tall young man, richly habited in the
Grecian fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious lord,&rdquo; said Lomellino, &ldquo;I
present to you the Count Flodoardo, who humbly sues for your
protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flodoardo uncovered his head in token of respect, took off his
mask, and bowed low before the illustrious ruler of Venice.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;I understand you are desirous of serving
the Republic?</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;That is my ambition, should your
Highness think me deserving of such an honour.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;Lomellino speaks highly of you; if all
that he says be true, how came you to deprive your own country of
your services?</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;Because my own country is not governed
by an Andreas.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;You have intentions, it seems, of
discovering the haunts of the banditti, who for some time past
have caused so many tears to flow in Venice?</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;If your Highness would deign to
confide in me, I would answer with my head for their delivery
into the hands of your officers, and that speedily.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;That were much for a stranger to
perform.&nbsp; I would fain make the trial whether you can keep
your word.</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;That is sufficient.&nbsp; To-morrow,
or the day after at least, will I perform my promise.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;And you make that promise so
resolutely?&nbsp; Are you aware, young man, how dangerous a task
it is to surprise these miscreants?&nbsp; They are never to be
found when sought for, and always present when least expected;
they are at once everywhere and nowhere.&nbsp; There exists not a
nook in Venice which our spies are not acquainted with, or have
left unexamined, and yet has our police endeavoured in vain to
discover the place of their concealment.</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;I know all this, and to know it
rejoices me, since it affords me an opportunity of convincing the
Doge of Venice, that my actions are not those of a common
adventurer.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;Perform your promise, and then let me
hear of you.&nbsp; For the present our discourse shall end here,
for no unpleasant thoughts must disturb the joy to which this day
is dedicated.&nbsp; Rosabella, would you not like to join the
dancers?&nbsp; Count, I confide her to your care.</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;I could not be entrusted with a more
precious charge.</p>
<p>Rosabella, during this conversation, had been leaning against
the back of her uncle&rsquo;s chair.&nbsp; She repeated to
herself Lomellino&rsquo;s assertion, &ldquo;that to see
Flodoardo, and not to like him, was as difficult as to look at
Paradise and not wish to enter;&rdquo; and while she gazed on the
youth, she allowed that Lomellino had not exaggerated.&nbsp; When
her uncle desired Flodoardo to conduct her to the dancers, a soft
blush overspread her cheek, and she doubted whether she should
accept or decline the hand which was immediately offered.</p>
<p>And to tell you my real opinion, my fair ladies, I suspect
that very few of you would have been more collected than
Rosabella, had you found yourselves similarly situated.&nbsp; In
truth, such a form as Flodoardo&rsquo;s; a countenance whose
physiognomy seemed a passport at once to the hearts of all who
examined it; features so exquisitely fashioned that the artist
who wished to execute a model of manly beauty, had he imitated
them, would have had nothing to supply or improve; features,
every one of which spoke so clearly, &ldquo;The bosom of this
youth contains the heart of a hero.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah, ladies, my
dear ladies, a man like this might well make some little
confusion in the head and heart of a poor young girl, tender and
unsuspicious!</p>
<p>Flodoardo took Rosabella&rsquo;s hand, and led her into the
ball-room.&nbsp; Here all was mirth and splendour, the roofs
re-echoed with the full swell of harmony, and the floor trembled
beneath the multitude of dancers, who formed a thousand beautiful
groups by the blaze of innumerable lustres.&nbsp; Yes, Flodoardo
and Rosabella passed on in silence till they reached the extreme
end of the great saloon.&nbsp; Here they stopped, and remained
before an open window.&nbsp; Some minutes passed, and still they
spoke not.&nbsp; Sometimes they gazed on each other, sometimes on
the dancers, sometimes on the moon; and then again they forgot
each other, the dancers, and the moon, and were totally absorbed
in themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said Flodoardo, at length, &ldquo;can
there be a greater misfortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A misfortune?&rdquo; said Rosabella, starting as if
suddenly awaking from a dream; &ldquo;what misfortune,
signor?&nbsp; Who is unfortunate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who is doomed to behold the joys of Elysium and
never to possess them.&nbsp; He who dies of thirst and sees a cup
stand full before him, but which he knows is destined for the
lips of another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you, my lord, this outcast from Elysium?&nbsp;
Are you the thirsty one who stands near the cup which is filled
for another?&nbsp; Is it thus that you wish me to understand your
speech?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand it as I meant: and now tell me, lovely
Rosabella, am I not indeed unfortunate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where, then, is the Elysium which you must never
possess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where Rosabella is, there is indeed Elysium.&nbsp; You
are not offended, signora?&rdquo; said Flodoardo, and took her
hand with an air of respectful tenderness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has this
openness displeased you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a native of Florence, Count Flodoardo.&nbsp; In
Venice we dislike this kind of compliment: at least I dislike
them, and wish to hear them from no one less than from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my life, signora, I spoke but as I thought! my words
concealed no flattery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, the Doge enters the saloon with Manfrone and
Lomellino: he will seek us among the dancers.&nbsp; Come, let us
join them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flodoardo followed her in silence.&nbsp; The dance
began.&nbsp; Heavens! how lovely looked Rosabella, as she glided
along to the sweet sounds of music, conducted by Flodoardo.&nbsp;
How handsome looked Flodoardo, as, lighter than air, he flew down
the dance, while his brilliant eyes saw no object but
Rosabella.</p>
<p>He was still without his mask, and bareheaded: but every eye
glanced away from the helmets and <i>barettes</i>, waving with
plumes, and sparkling with jewels, to gaze on Flodoardo&rsquo;s
raven locks, as they floated on the air in wild luxuriance.&nbsp;
A murmur of admiration rose from every corner of the saloon, but
it rose unmarked by those who were the objects of it.&nbsp;
Neither Rosabella nor Flodoardo at that moment formed a wish to
be applauded, except by each other.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE FLORENTINE STRANGER.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> evenings had elapsed since the
Doge&rsquo;s entertainment.&nbsp; On the second, Parozzi sat in
his own apartment, with Memmo and Falieri.&nbsp; Dimly burnt the
lights; lowering and tempestuous were the skies without; gloomy
and fearful were the souls of the libertines within.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i> (after a long silence).&mdash;What, are you
both dreaming?&nbsp; Ho, there, Memmo, Falieri, fill your
goblets.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i> (with indifference).&mdash;Well, to please
you&mdash;.&nbsp; But I care not for wine to-night.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Nor I.&nbsp; Methinks it tastes like
vinegar: yet the wine itself is good: &rsquo;tis our ill temper
spoils it.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Confound the rascals.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;What, the banditti?</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Not a trace of them can be found.&nbsp;
It is enough to kill one with vexation.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;And in the meanwhile the time runs out,
our projects will get wind, and then we shall sit quietly in the
State prisons of Venice, objects of derision to the populace and
ourselves.&nbsp; I could tear my flesh for anger.&nbsp; (A
universal silence.)</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i> (striking his hand against the table
passionately).&mdash;Flodoardo, Flodoardo.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;In a couple of hours I must attend the
Cardinal Gonzaga, and what intelligence shall I have to give
him?</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;Come, come, Contarino cannot have been
absent so long without cause; I warrant you he will bring some
news with him when he arrives.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Pshaw, pshaw!&nbsp; My life on&rsquo;t
he lies at this moment at Olympia&rsquo;s feet, and forgets us,
the Republic, the banditti, and himself.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;And so neither of you know anything of
this Flodoardo?</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;No more than of what happened on
Rosabella&rsquo;s birthday.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Well, then, I know one thing more about
him; Parozzi is jealous of him.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;I?&nbsp; Ridiculous, Rosabella may
bestow her hand on the German Emperor, or a Venetian gondolier,
without its giving me the least anxiety.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;Well, one thing at least even envy must
confess; Flodoardo is the handsomest man in Venice.&nbsp; I doubt
whether there&rsquo;s a woman in the city who can resist him.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;And I should doubt it too, if women had
as little sense as you have, and looked only at the shell without
minding the kernel&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;Which unluckily is exactly the thing which
women always do&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;The old Lomellino seems to be extremely
intimate with this Flodoardo.&nbsp; They say he was well
acquainted with his father.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;It was he who presented him to the
Doge.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Hark!&mdash;Surely some one knocked at
the palace door?</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;It can be none but Contarino.&nbsp; Now,
then, we shall hear whether he has discovered the banditti.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i> (starting from his chair).&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
swear to that footstep, it&rsquo;s Contarino.</p>
<p>The doors were thrown open.&nbsp; Contarino entered hastily,
enveloped in his cloak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, sweet gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, and
threw his mantle aside.&nbsp; And Memmo, Parozzi, and Falieri
started back in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; they exclaimed, &ldquo;what has
happened?&nbsp; You are covered with blood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trifle!&rdquo; cried Contarino; &ldquo;is that wine?
quick, give me a goblet of it, I expire with thirst.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i> (while he gives him a cup).&mdash;But,
Contarino, you bleed?</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;You need not tell me that.&nbsp; I did
not do it myself, I promise you.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;First let us bind up your wounds, and
then tell us what has happened to you.&nbsp; It is as well that
the servants should remain ignorant of your adventure; I will be
your surgeon myself.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;What has happened to me, say
you?&nbsp; Oh! a joke, gentlemen, a mere joke.&nbsp; Here,
Falieri, fill the bowl again.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;I can scarcely breathe for terror.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Very possibly; neither should I, were
I Memmo instead of being Contarino.&nbsp; The wound bleeds
plenteously it&rsquo;s true, but it&rsquo;s by no means dangerous
(he tore open his doublet, and uncovered his bosom).&nbsp; There,
look, comrades; you see it&rsquo;s only a cut of not more than
two inches deep.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i> (shuddering).&mdash;Mercy on me! the very sight
of it makes my blood run cold.</p>
<p>Parozzi brought ointments and linen, and bound up the wound of
his associate.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Old Horace is in the right.&nbsp; A
philosopher can be anything he pleases, a cobbler, a king, or a
physician.&nbsp; Only observe with what dignified address the
philosopher Parozzi spreads that plaster for me.&nbsp; I thank
you, friend; that&rsquo;s enough: and now, comrades, place
yourselves in a circle round me, and listen to the wonders which
I am going to relate.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Proceed.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;As soon as it was twilight, I stole
out, wrapped in my cloak, determined if possible to discover some
of the banditti.&nbsp; I knew not their persons, neither were
they acquainted with mine.&nbsp; An extravagant undertaking,
perhaps, you will tell me; but I was resolved to convince you
that everything which a man <i>determines</i> to do, may be
done.&nbsp; I had some information respecting the rascals, though
it was but slight, and on these grounds I proceeded.&nbsp; I
happened by mere accident to stumble upon a gondolier, whose
appearance excited my curiosity.&nbsp; I fell into discourse with
him.&nbsp; I was soon convinced that he was not ignorant of the
lurking-place of the bravoes, and by means of some gold and many
fair speeches, I at length brought him to confess that though not
regularly belonging to the band, he had occasionally been
employed by them.&nbsp; I immediately made a bargain with him; he
conducted me in his gondola through the greatest part of Venice,
sometimes right, sometimes left, till I lost every idea as to the
quarter of the town in which I found myself.&nbsp; At length he
insisted on binding my eyes with his handkerchief, and I was
compelled to submit.&nbsp; Half an hour elapsed before the
gondola stopped.&nbsp; He told me to descend, conducted me
through a couple of streets, and at length knocked at a door,
where he left me still blindfolded.&nbsp; The door was opened; my
business was inquired with great caution, and after some demur I
was at length admitted.&nbsp; The handkerchief was now withdrawn
from my eyes, and I found myself in a small chamber, surrounded
by four men of not the most creditable appearance, and a young
woman, who (it seems) had opened the door for me.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;You are a daring fellow, Contarino.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Here was no time to be lost.&nbsp; I
instantly threw my purse on the table, promised them mountains of
gold, and fixed on particular days, hours, and signals which were
necessary to facilitate our future intercourse.&nbsp; For the
present I only required that Manfrone, Conari, and Lomellino
should be removed with all possible expedition.</p>
<p><i>All</i>.&mdash;Bravo.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;So far everything went exactly as we
could have wished, and one of my new associates was just setting
out to guide me home, when we were surprised by an unexpected
visit.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Well?</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i> (anxiously).&mdash;Go on, for God&rsquo;s
sake!</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;A knocking was heard at the door; the
girl went to inquire the cause.&nbsp; In an instant she returned
pale as a corpse, and &ldquo;Fly! fly!&rdquo; cried she.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;What followed?</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Why then followed a whole legion of
sbirri and police-officers, and who should be at their head but
the Florentine stranger.</p>
<p><i>All</i>.&mdash;Flodoardo?&nbsp; What, Flodoardo?</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Flodoardo.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;What demon could have guided him
thither?</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Hell and furies!&nbsp; Oh, that I had
been there.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;There, now, Parozzi, you see at least that
Flodoardo is no coward.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Hush, let us hear the rest.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;We stood as if we had been petrified;
not a soul could stir a finger.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the name of the
Doge and the Republic,&rdquo; cried Flodoardo, &ldquo;yield
yourselves and deliver your arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The devil
shall yield himself sooner than we,&rdquo; exclaimed one of the
banditti, and forced a sword from one of the officers.&nbsp; The
others snatched their muskets from the walls; and as for me, my
first care was to extinguish the lamp so that we could not tell
friends from foes.&nbsp; But still the confounded moonshine
gleamed through the window-shutters, and shed a partial light
through the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look to yourself,
Contarino,&rdquo; thought I; &ldquo;if you are found here, you
will be hanged for company,&rdquo; and I drew my sword and made a
plunge at Flodoardo; but, however well intended, my thrust was
foiled by his sabre, which he whirled around with the rapidity of
lightning.&nbsp; I fought like a madman, but all my skill was
without effect on this occasion, and before I was aware of it,
Flodoardo ripped open my bosom.&nbsp; I felt myself wounded, and
sprang back.&nbsp; At that moment two pistols were fired, and the
flash discovered to me a small side door, which they had
neglected to beset.&nbsp; Through this I stole unperceived into
the adjoining chamber, burst open the grated window, sprang below
unhurt, crossed a courtyard, climbed two or three garden walls,
gained the canal, where a gondola fortunately was waiting,
persuaded the boatman to convey me with all speed to the Place of
St. Mark, and thence hastened hither, astonished to find myself
still alive.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s an infernal adventure for
you.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;I shall go mad.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Everything we design is counteracted;
the more trouble we give ourselves, the further we are from the
goal.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;I confess it seems to me as if Heaven gave
us warning to desist.&nbsp; How say you?</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Pshaw, these are trifles!&nbsp; Such
accidents should only serve to sharpen our wits.&nbsp; The more
obstacles I encounter, the firmer is my resolution to surmount
them.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Do the banditti know who you are?</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;No; they are not only ignorant of my
name, but suppose me to be a mere instrument of some powerful
man, who has been injured by the ducal confederates.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;Well, Contarino, in my mind you should
thank Heaven that you have escaped so well.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;But since he is an absolute stranger in
Venice, how could Flodoardo discover the lurking place of the
banditti?</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;I know not; probably by mere accident
like myself, but by the Power that made me, he shall pay dearly
for this wound.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Flodoardo is rather too hasty in making
himself remarked.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Flodoardo must die.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i> (filling a goblet).&mdash;May his next cup
contain poison.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;I shall do myself the honour of becoming
better acquainted with the gentleman.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Memmo, we must needs have full purses,
or our business will hang on hand wofully.</p>
<p>When does your uncle take his departure to a better world?</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;To-morrow evening, and yet&mdash;ugh, I
tremble.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MORE CONFUSION.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> Rosabella&rsquo;s birthday,
no woman in Venice who had the slightest pretensions to beauty,
or the most remote expectations of making conquests, had any
subject of conversation except the handsome Florentine.&nbsp; He
found employment for every female tongue, and she who dared not
to employ her tongue, made amends for the privation with her
thoughts.&nbsp; Many a maiden now enjoyed less tranquil slumbers;
many an experienced coquette sighed as she laid on her colour at
the looking glass; many a prude forgot the rules which she had
imposed upon herself, and daily frequented the gardens and walks
in which report gave her the hope of meeting Flodoardo.</p>
<p>But from the time that, placing himself at the head of the
sbirri, he had dared to enter boldly the den of the banditti, and
seize them at the hazard of his life, he was scarcely more an
object of attention among the women than among the men.&nbsp;
Greatly did they admire his courage and unshaken presence of mind
while engaged in so perilous an adventure; but still more were
they astonished at his penetration in discovering where the
bravoes concealed themselves, an attempt which foiled even the
keen wits of the so much celebrated police of Venice.</p>
<p>The Doge Andreas cultivated the acquaintance of this singular
young man with increasing assiduity; and the more he conversed
with him, the more deserving of consideration did Flodoardo
appear.&nbsp; The action by which he had rendered the Republic a
service so essential was rewarded by a present that would not
have disgraced Imperial gratitude, and one of the most important
offices of the State was confided to his superintendence.</p>
<p>Both favours were conferred unsolicited, but no sooner was the
Florentine apprised of the Doge&rsquo;s benevolent care of him,
than with modesty and respect he requested to decline the
proposed advantages.&nbsp; The only favour which he requested
was, to be permitted to live free and independent in Venice
during a year, at the end of which he promised to name that
employment which he esteemed the best adapted to his abilities
and inclination.</p>
<p>Flodoardo was lodged in the magnificent palace of his good old
patron, Lomellino, here he lived in the closest retirement,
studied the most valuable parts of ancient and modern literature,
remained for whole days together in his own apartment, and was
seldom to be seen in public except upon some great solemnity.</p>
<p>But the Doge, Lomellino, Manfrone, and Conari, men who had
established the fame of Venice on so firm a basis that it would
require centuries to undermine it; men in whose society one
seemed to be withdrawn from the circle of ordinary mortals, and
honoured by the intercourse of superior beings, men who now
graciously received the Florentine stranger into their intimacy,
and resolved to spare no pains in forming him to support the
character of a great man; it could not long escape the
observation of men like these, that Flodoardo&rsquo;s gaiety was
assumed, and that a secret sorrow preyed upon his heart.</p>
<p>In vain did Lomellino, who loved him like a father, endeavour
to discover the source of his melancholy; in vain did the
venerable Doge exert himself to dispel the gloom which oppressed
his young favourite.&nbsp; Flodoardo remained silent and sad.</p>
<p>And Rosabella?&nbsp; Rosabella would have belied her sex had
she remained gay while Flodoardo sorrowed.&nbsp; Her spirits were
flown, her eyes were frequently obscured with tears.&nbsp; She
grew daily paler and paler, till the Doge, who doted on her, was
seriously alarmed for her health.&nbsp; At length Rosabella grew
really ill; a fever fixed itself upon her; she became weak, and
was confined to her chamber, and her complaint baffled the skill
of the most experienced physicians in Venice.</p>
<p>In the midst of these unpleasant circumstances in which
Andreas and his friends now found themselves, an incident
occurred one morning, which raised their uneasiness to the very
highest pitch.&nbsp; Never had so bold and audacious an action
been heard of in Venice, as that which I am going to relate.</p>
<p>The four banditti, whom Flodoardo had seized, Pietrino,
Struzza, Baluzza, and Thomaso, had been safely committed to the
Doge&rsquo;s dungeons, where they underwent a daily examination,
and looked upon every sun that rose as the last that would ever
rise for <i>them</i>.&nbsp; Andreas and his confidential
counsellors now flattered themselves that the public tranquillity
had nothing more to apprehend, and that Venice was now completely
purified of the miscreants, whom gold could bribe to be the
instruments of revenge and cruelty; when all at once the
following address was discovered, affixed to most of the
remarkable statues, and pasted against the corners of the
principal streets, and pillars of the public
buildings:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;VENETIANS!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Struzza, Thomaso, Pietrino, Baluzza, and Matteo, five
as brave men as the world ever produced, who, had they stood at
the head of armies, would have been called <i>heroes</i>, and now
being called <i>banditti</i>, are fallen victims to the injustice
of State policy.&nbsp; These men, it is true, exist for you no
longer; but their place is supplied by him, whose name is affixed
to this paper, and who will stand by his employers with body and
with soul.&nbsp; I laugh at the vigilance of the Venetian police;
I laugh at the crafty and insolent Florentine, whose hand has
dragged his brethren to the rack.&nbsp; Let those who need me,
seek me; they will find me everywhere!&nbsp; Let those who seek
me with the design of delivering me up to the law, despair and
tremble; they will find me nowhere, but <i>I</i> shall find
<i>them</i>, and that when they least expect me!&nbsp; Venetians,
you understand me!&nbsp; Woe to the man who shall attempt to
discover me; his life and death depend upon my pleasure.&nbsp;
This comes from the Venetian Bravo, <span
class="smcap">Abellino</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred sequins,&rdquo; exclaimed the incensed Doge,
on reading the paper, &ldquo;a hundred sequins to him who
discovers this monster Abellino, and a thousand to him who
delivers him up to justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in vain did spies ransack every lurking place in Venice;
no Abellino was to be found.&nbsp; In vain did the luxurious, the
avaricious, and the hungry stretch their wits to the utmost,
incited by the tempting promise of a thousand sequins.&nbsp;
Abellino&rsquo;s prudence set all their ingenuity at
defiance.</p>
<p>But not the less did every one assert that he had recognised
Abellino, sometimes in one disguise, and sometimes in another, as
an old man, a gondolier, a woman, or a monk.&nbsp; Everybody had
seen him somewhere; but, unluckily, nobody could tell where he
was to be seen again.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE VIOLET.</span></h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">informed</span> my readers, in the
beginning of the last chapter, that Flodoardo was become
melancholy, and that Rosabella was indisposed, but I did not tell
them what had occasioned this sudden change.</p>
<p>Flodoardo, who on his first arrival at Venice was all gaiety,
and the life of every society in which he mingled, lost his
spirits on one particular day; and it so happened that it was on
the very same day that Rosabella betrayed the first symptoms of
indisposition.</p>
<p>For on this unlucky day did the caprice of accident, or
perhaps the Goddess of Love (who has her caprices too every now
and then), conduct Rosabella into her uncle&rsquo;s garden, which
none but the Doge&rsquo;s intimate friends were permitted to
enter; and where the Doge himself frequently reposed in solitude
and silence during the evening hours of a sultry day.</p>
<p>Rosabella, lost in thought, wandered listless and unconscious
along the broad and shady alleys of the garden.&nbsp; Sometimes,
in a moment of vexation, she plucked the unoffending leaves from
the hedges and strewed them upon the ground; sometimes she
stopped suddenly, then rushed forward with impetuosity, then
again stood still, and gazed upon the clear blue heaven.&nbsp;
Sometimes her beautiful bosom was heaved with quick and irregular
motion, and sometimes a half-suppressed sigh escaped from her
lips of coral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is very handsome!&rdquo; she murmured, and gazed
with such eagerness on vacancy, as though she had there seen
something which was hidden from the sight of common
observers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet Camilla is in the right,&rdquo; she resumed, after
a pause, and she frowned as had she said that Camilla was in the
wrong.</p>
<p>This Camilla was her governess, her friend, her confidante, I
may almost say her mother.&nbsp; Rosabella had lost her parents
early.&nbsp; Her mother died when her child could scarcely lisp
her name; and her father, Guiscardo of Corfu, the commander of a
Venetian vessel, eight years before had perished in an engagement
with the Turks, while he was still in the prime of life.&nbsp;
Camilla, one of the worthiest creatures that ever dignified the
name of woman, supplied to Rosabella the place of mother, had
brought her up from infancy, and was now her best friend, and the
person to whose ear she confided all her little secrets.</p>
<p>While Rosabella was still buried in her own reflections, the
excellent Camilla advanced from a side path, and hastened to join
her pupil.&nbsp; Rosabella started.</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i>.&mdash;Ah! dear Camilla, is it you?&nbsp;
What brings you hither?</p>
<p><i>Camilla</i>.&mdash;You often call me your guardian angel,
and guardian angels should always be near the object of their
care.</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i>.&mdash;Camilla, I have been thinking over
your arguments; I cannot deny that all you have said to me is
very true, and very wise, but still&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Camilla</i>.&mdash;But still, though your prudence agrees
with me, your heart is of a contrary opinion.</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i>.&mdash;It is, indeed.</p>
<p><i>Camilla</i>.&mdash;Nor do I blame your heart for differing
from me, my poor girl.&nbsp; I have acknowledged to you without
disguise that were <i>I</i> at your time of life, and were such a
man as Flodoardo to throw himself in my way, I could not receive
his attentions with indifference.&nbsp; It cannot be denied that
this young stranger is uncommonly pleasing, and, indeed, for any
woman whose heart is disengaged, an uncommonly <i>dangerous</i>
companion.&nbsp; There is something very prepossessing in his
appearance, his manners are elegant, and short as has been his
abode in Venice, it is already past doubting that there are many
noble and striking features in his character.&nbsp; But alas,
after all, he is but a poor nobleman, and it is not very probable
that the rich and powerful Doge of Venice will ever bestow his
niece on one who, to speak plainly, arrived here little better
than a beggar.&nbsp; No, no, child, believe me, a romantic
adventurer is no fit husband for Rosabella of Corfu.</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i>.&mdash;Dear Camilla, who was talking about
husbands?&nbsp; What I feel for Flodoardo is merely affection,
friendship.</p>
<p><i>Camilla</i>.&mdash;Indeed!&nbsp; Then you would be
perfectly satisfied, should some one of our wealthy ladies bestow
her hand on Flodoardo?</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i> (hastily).&mdash;Oh! Flodoardo would not
<i>accept</i> her hand, Camilla; of that I am sure.</p>
<p><i>Camilla</i>.&mdash;Child, child, you would willingly
deceive yourself.&nbsp; But be assured that a girl who loves ever
connects, perhaps unconsciously, the wish for an eternal
<i>union</i> with the idea of eternal <i>affection</i>.&nbsp; Now
this is a wish which you cannot indulge in regard to Flodoardo
without seriously offending your uncle, who, good man as he is,
must still submit to the severe control of politics and
etiquette.</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i>.&mdash;I know all that, Camilla, but can I
not make you comprehend that I am not in love with Flodoardo, and
do not mean to be in love with him, and that love has nothing at
all to do in the business?&nbsp; I repeat to you, what I feel for
him is nothing but sincere and fervent friendship; and surely
Flodoardo deserves that I should feel that sentiment for
him.&nbsp; Deserves it, said I?&nbsp; Oh, what does Flodoardo
<i>not</i> deserve?</p>
<p><i>Camilla</i>.&mdash;Ay, ay, friendship, indeed, and
love.&nbsp; Oh, Rosabella, you know not how often these deceivers
borrow each other&rsquo;s mask to ensnare the hearts of
unsuspecting maidens.&nbsp; You know not how often love finds
admission, when wrapped in friendship&rsquo;s cloak, into that
bosom, which, had he approached under his own appearance, would
have been closed against him for ever.&nbsp; In short, my child,
reflect how much you owe to your uncle; reflect how much
uneasiness this inclination would cost him; and sacrifice to duty
what at present is a mere caprice, but which, if encouraged,
might make too deep an impression on your heart to be afterwards
removed by your best efforts.</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i>.&mdash;You say right, Camilla.&nbsp; I really
believe myself that my prepossession in Flodoardo&rsquo;s favour
is merely an accidental fancy, of which I shall easily get the
better.&nbsp; No, no; I am not in love with Flodoardo&mdash;of
that you may rest assured.&nbsp; I even think that I rather feel
an antipathy towards him, since you have shown me the possibility
of his making me prove a cause of uneasiness to my kind, my
excellent uncle.</p>
<p><i>Camilla</i> (smiling).&mdash;Are your sentiments of duty
and gratitude so very strong?</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i>.&mdash;Oh, that they are, Camilla; and so you
will say yourself hereafter.&nbsp; This disagreeable
Flodoardo&mdash;to give me so much vexation!&nbsp; I wish he had
never come to Venice.&nbsp; I declare I do not like him at
all.</p>
<p><i>Camilla</i>.&mdash;No&mdash;what!&nbsp; Not like
Flodoardo?</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i> (casting down her eyes).&mdash;No, not at
all.&nbsp; Not that I wish him ill, either, for you know,
Camilla, there&rsquo;s no reason why I should hate this poor
Flodoardo!</p>
<p><i>Camilla</i>.&mdash;Well, we will resume this subject when I
return.&nbsp; I have business, and the gondola waits for
me.&nbsp; Farewell, my child; and do not lay aside your
resolution as hastily as you took it up.</p>
<p><i>Camilla</i> departed, and Rosabella remained melancholy and
uncertain.&nbsp; She built castles in the air, and destroyed them
as soon as built.&nbsp; She formed wishes, and condemned herself
for having formed them.&nbsp; She looked round her frequently in
search of something, but dared not confess to herself what it was
of which she was in search.</p>
<p>The evening was sultry, and Rosabella was compelled to shelter
herself from the sun&rsquo;s overpowering heat.&nbsp; In the
garden was a small fountain, bordered by a bank of moss, over
which the magic hands of art and nature had formed a canopy of
ivy and jessamine.&nbsp; Thither she bent her steps.&nbsp; She
arrived at the fountain, and instantly drew back, covered with
blushes, for on the bank of moss, shaded by the protecting
canopy, whose waving blossoms were reflected on the fountain,
Flodoardo was seated, and fixed his eyes on a roll of
parchment.</p>
<p>Rosabella hesitated whether she should retire or stay.&nbsp;
Flodoardo started from his place, apparently in no less confusion
than herself, and relieved her from her indecision by taking her
hand with respect, and conducting her to the seat which he had
just quitted.</p>
<p>Now, then, she could not possibly retire immediately, unless
she meant to violate every common principle of good breeding.</p>
<p>Her hand was still clasped in Flodoardo&rsquo;s; but it was so
natural for him to take it, that she could not blame him for
having done so.&nbsp; But what was she next to do?&nbsp; Draw her
hand away?&nbsp; Why should she, since he did her hand no harm by
keeping it, and the keeping it seemed to make him so happy?&nbsp;
And how could the gentle Rosabella resolve to commit an act of
such unheard-of cruelty as wilfully to deprive any one of a
pleasure which made him so happy, and which did herself no
harm?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signora,&rdquo; said Flodoardo, merely for the sake of
saying something, &ldquo;you do well to enjoy the open air.&nbsp;
The evening is beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I interrupt your studies, my lord,&rdquo; said
Rosabella.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; answered Flodoardo; and there this
interesting conversation came to a full stop.&nbsp; Both looked
down; both examined the heaven and the earth, the trees and the
flowers, in the hopes of finding some hints for renewing the
conversation; but the more anxiously they sought them, the more
difficult did it seem to find what they sought; and in this
painful embarrassment did two whole precious minutes elapse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, what a beautiful flower!&rdquo; suddenly cried
Rosabella, in order to break the silence, then stooped and
plucked a violet with an appearance of the greatest eagerness,
though, in fact, nothing at that moment could have been more a
matter of indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very beautiful flower, indeed,&rdquo; gravely
observed Flodoardo, and was out of all patience with himself for
having made so flat a speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing can surpass this purple,&rdquo; continued
Rosabella; &ldquo;red and blue so happily blended, that no
painter can produce so perfect a union.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red and blue&mdash;the one the symbol of happiness, the
other of affection.&nbsp; Ah, Rosabella! how enviable will be
that man&rsquo;s lot on whom your hand shall bestow such a
flower.&nbsp; Happiness and affection are not more inseparably
united than the red and blue which purple that violet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to attach a value to the flower of which it is
but little deserving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might I but know on whom Rosabella will one day bestow
what that flower expresses.&nbsp; Yet, this is a subject which I
have no right to discuss.&nbsp; I know not what has happened to
me to-day.&nbsp; I make nothing but blunders and mistakes.&nbsp;
Forgive my presumption, lady.&nbsp; I will hazard such forward
inquiries no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent.&nbsp; Rosabella was silent also.</p>
<p>But though they could forbid their lips to betray their hidden
affection; though Rosabella said not&mdash;&ldquo;Thou art he on
whom this flower shall be bestowed:&rdquo; though
Flodoardo&rsquo;s words had not expressed&mdash;&ldquo;Rosabella,
give me that violet, and that which it implies&rdquo;&mdash;oh,
their eyes were far from being silent.&nbsp; Those treacherous
interpreters of secret feelings acknowledged more to each other
than their hearts had yet acknowledged to themselves.</p>
<p>Flodoardo and Rosabella gazed on each other with looks which
made all speech unnecessary.&nbsp; Sweet, tender, and
enthusiastic was the smile which played around Rosabella&rsquo;s
lips when her eyes met those of the youth whom she had selected
from the rest of mankind; and with mingled emotions of hope and
fear did the youth study the meaning of that smile.&nbsp; He
understood it, and his heart beat louder, and his eye flamed
brighter.</p>
<p>Rosabella trembled; her eyes could no longer sustain the fire
of his glances, and a modest blush overspread her face and
bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosabella!&rdquo; at length murmured Flodoardo,
unconsciously; &ldquo;Flodoardo!&rdquo; sighed Rosabella, in the
same tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me that violet!&rdquo; he exclaimed, eagerly, then
sank at her feet, and in a tone of the most humble supplication
repeated, &ldquo;Oh, give it to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosabella held the flower fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask for it what thou wilt.&nbsp; If a throne can
purchase it, I will pay that price, or perish.&nbsp; Rosabella,
give me that flower!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stole one look at the handsome suppliant and dared not
hazard a second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My repose, my happiness, my life&mdash;nay, even my
glory, all depend on the possession of that little flower.&nbsp;
Let that be mine, and here I solemnly renounce all else which the
world calls precious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flower trembled in her snowy hand.&nbsp; Her fingers
clasped it less firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear me, Rosabella?&nbsp; I kneel at your feet; and
am I then in vain a beggar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;beggar&rdquo; recalled to her memory Camilla
and her prudent counsels.&nbsp; &ldquo;What am I doing?&rdquo;
she said to herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have I forgotten my promise, my
resolution?&nbsp; Fly, Rosabella, fly, or this hour makes you
faithless to yourself and duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tore the flower to pieces, and threw it contemptuously on
the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand you, Flodoardo,&rdquo; said she;
&ldquo;and having understood you, will never suffer this subject
to be renewed.&nbsp; Here let us part, and let me not again be
offended by a similar presumption.&nbsp; Farewell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned from him with disdain, and left Flodoardo rooted to
his place with sorrow and astonishment.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE ASSASSIN.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Scarcely</span> had she reached her
chamber ere Rosabella repented her having acted so
courageously.&nbsp; It was cruel in her, she thought, to have
given him so harsh an answer.&nbsp; She recollected with what
hopeless and melancholy looks the poor thunderstruck youth had
followed her steps as she turned to leave him.&nbsp; She fancied
that she saw him stretched despairing on the earth, his hair
dishevelled, his eyes filled with tears.&nbsp; She heard him term
her the murderess of his repose, pray for death as his only
refuge; and she saw him with every moment approach towards the
attainment of his prayer through the tears which he shed on her
account.&nbsp; Already she heard those dreadful
words&mdash;&ldquo;Flodoardo is no more.&rdquo;&nbsp; Already she
saw the sympathising multitude weep round the tomb of him whom
all the virtuous loved, and whom the wicked dreaded; whom all his
friends adored, and whom even his enemies admired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! alas!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;this was but a
wretched attempt to play the heroine.&nbsp; Already does my
resolution fail me.&nbsp; Ah, Flodoardo!&nbsp; I meant not what I
said.&nbsp; I love you&mdash;love you now, and must love you
always, though Camilla may chide, and though my good uncle may
hate me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few days after this interview she understood that an
extraordinary alteration had taken place in Flodoardo&rsquo;s
manner and appearance; that he had withdrawn himself from all
general society; and that when the solicitations of his intimate
friends compelled him to appear in their circle, his spirits
seemed evidently depressed by the weight of an unconquerable
melancholy.</p>
<p>This intelligence was like the stroke of a poniard to the
feeling heart of Rosabella.&nbsp; She fled for shelter to the
solitude of her chamber, there indulged her feelings without
restraint, and lamented, with showers of repentant tears, her
harsh treatment of Flodoardo.</p>
<p>The grief which preyed in secret on her soul soon undermined
her health.&nbsp; No one could relieve her sufferings, for no one
knew the cause of her melancholy, or the origin of her
illness.&nbsp; No wonder, then, that Rosabella&rsquo;s situation
at length excited the most bitter anxiety in the bosom of her
venerable uncle.&nbsp; No wonder, too, that Flodoardo entirely
withdrew himself from a world which was become odious to him,
since Rosabella was to be seen in it no longer; and that he
devoted himself in solitude to the indulgence of a passion which
he had vainly endeavoured to subdue, and which, in the
impetuosity of its course, had already swallowed up every other
wish, and every other sentiment.</p>
<p>But let us for the moment turn from the sick chamber of
Rosabella, and visit the dwellings of the conspirators, who were
now advancing with rapid strides towards the execution of their
plans; and who, with every hour that passed over their heads,
became more numerous, more powerful, and more dangerous to
Andreas and his beloved Republic.</p>
<p>Parozzi, Memmo, Contarino, Falieri, the chiefs of this
desperate undertaking, now assembled frequently in the Cardinal
Gonzaga&rsquo;s palace, where different plans for altering the
constitution of Venice were brought forward and discussed.&nbsp;
But in all different schemes it was evident that the proposer was
solely actuated by considerations of private interest.&nbsp; The
object of one was to get free from the burden of enormous debts;
another was willing to sacrifice everything to gratify his
inordinate ambition.&nbsp; The cupidity of <i>this</i> man was
excited by the treasures of Andreas and his friends; while
<i>that</i> was actuated by resentment of some fancied offence, a
resentment which could only be quenched with the offender&rsquo;s
blood.</p>
<p>These execrable wretches, who aimed at nothing less than the
total overthrow of Venice, or at least of her government, looked
towards the completion of their extravagant hopes with the
greater confidence, since a new but necessary addition to the
already existing taxes had put the Venetian populace out of
humour with their rulers.</p>
<p>Rich enough, both in adherents and in wealth, to realise their
projects, rich enough in bold, shrewd, desperate men, whose minds
were well adapted to the contrivance and execution of
revolutionary projects, they now looked down with contempt upon
the good old Doge, who as yet entertained no suspicion of their
nocturnal meetings.</p>
<p>Still did they not dare to carry their projects into effect,
till some principal persons in the State should be prevented by
<i>death</i> from throwing obstacles in their way.&nbsp; For the
accomplishment of this part of their plan they relied on the
daggers of the banditti.&nbsp; Dreadful therefore was the sound
in their ears, when the bell gave the signal for execution, and
they saw their best-founded hopes expire on the scaffold, which
supported the headless trunks of the four bravoes.&nbsp; But if
their consternation was great at thus losing the destined
instruments of their designs, how extravagant was their joy when
the proud Abellino dared openly to declare to Venice that he
still inhabited the Republic, and that he still wore a dagger at
the disposal of Vice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This desperado is the very man for us!&rdquo; they
exclaimed unanimously, and in rapture; and now their most ardent
wish was to enroll Abellino in their services.</p>
<p>Their object was soon attained&mdash;they sought the daring
ruffian, and he suffered himself to be found.&nbsp; He visited
their meetings, but in his promises and demands he was equally
extravagant.</p>
<p>The first and most earnest wish of the whole conspiracy was
the death of Conari, the Procurator, a man whom the Doge valued
beyond all others, a man whose eagle eyes made the conspirators
hourly tremble for their secret, and whose service the Doge had
accepted, in preference to those of the Cardinal Gonzaga.&nbsp;
But the sum which Abellino demanded for the murder of this one
man was enormous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the reward which I require,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and I promise, on the word of a man of honour, that after
this night the Procurator, Conari, shall give you no further
trouble.&nbsp; Exalt him to heaven, or imprison him in hell,
I&rsquo;ll engage to find and stab him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What could they do?&nbsp; Abellino was not a man to be easily
beat down in his demands.&nbsp; The Cardinal was impatient to
attain the summit of his wishes; but his road lay straight over
Conari&rsquo;s grave!</p>
<p>Abellino received the sum demanded; the next day the venerable
Conari, the Doge&rsquo;s best and dearest friend, the pride and
safeguard of the Republic, was no longer numbered among the
living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a terrible fellow, this Abellino!&rdquo;
cried the conspirators, when the news reached them, and
celebrated the Procurator&rsquo;s death in triumph at the
Cardinal&rsquo;s midnight feast.</p>
<p>The Doge was almost distracted with terror and
astonishment.&nbsp; He engaged to give ten thousand sequins to
any one who should discover by whom Conari had been removed from
the world.&nbsp; A proclamation to this effect was published at
the corner of every street in Venice, and made known throughout
the territories of the Republic.&nbsp; A few days after this
proclamation had been made, a paper was discovered affixed to the
principal door of the Venetian Signoria.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;VENETIANS!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would fain know the author of Conari&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; To spare you much fruitless trouble, I hereby
acknowledge that I, Abellino, was his assassin.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE TWO GREATEST MEN IN
VENICE.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> must be superfluous to inform my
readers that all Venice became furious at this new
insolence.&nbsp; Within the memory of man had no one ever treated
with such derision the celebrated Venetian police, or set the
Doge&rsquo;s power at defiance with such proud temerity.&nbsp;
This occurrence threw the whole city into confusion; every one
was on the look-out; the patrols were doubled; the sbirri
extended their researches on all sides; yet no one could see, or
hear, or discover the most distant trace of Abellino.</p>
<p>The priests in their sermons strove to rouse the slumbering
vengeance of Heaven to crush this insolent offender.&nbsp; The
ladies were ready to swoon at the very name of Abellino, for who
could assure them that, at some unexpected moment, he might not
pay <i>them</i> the same compliment which he had paid to
Rosabella?&nbsp; As for the old women, they unanimously asserted
that Abellino had sold himself to the Prince of Darkness, by
whose assistance he was enabled to sport with the patience of all
pious Venetians, and deride the impotence of their just
indignation.&nbsp; The Cardinal and his associates were proud of
their terrible confederate, and looking forward with confidence
to the triumphant issue of their undertaking.&nbsp; The deserted
family of Conari called down curses on his murderer&rsquo;s head,
and wished that their tears might be changed into a sea of
sulphur, in whose waves they might plunge the monster Abellino;
nor did Conari&rsquo;s relations feel more grief for his loss
than the Doge and his two confidants, who swore never to rest
till they had discovered the lurking-place of this ruthless
assassin, and had punished his crime with tenfold vengeance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, after all,&rdquo; said Andreas one evening, as he
sat alone in his private chamber, &ldquo;after all, it must be
confessed that this Abellino is a singular man.&nbsp; He who can
do what Abellino has done must possess both such talents and such
courage as, stood he at the head of an army, would enable him to
conquer half the world.&nbsp; Would that I could once get a sight
of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look up, then!&rdquo; roared Abellino, and clapped the
Doge on the shoulder.&nbsp; Andreas started from his seat.&nbsp;
A colossal figure stood before him, wrapped in a dark mantle
above which appeared a countenance so hideous and forbidding,
that the universe could not have produced its equal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; stammered out the Doge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou seest me, and canst doubt?&nbsp; Well, then, I am
Abellino, the good friend of your murdered Conari, the
Republic&rsquo;s most submissive slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brave Andreas, who had never trembled in fight by land or
by sea, and for whom no danger had possessed terrors sufficient
to shake his undaunted resolution, the brave Andreas now forgot
for a few moments his usual presence of mind.&nbsp; Speechless
did he gaze on the daring assassin, who stood before him calm and
haughty, unappalled by the majesty of the greatest man in
Venice.</p>
<p>Abellino nodded to him with an air of familiar protection, and
graciously condescended to grin upon him with a kind of
half-friendly smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abellino,&rdquo; said the Doge, at length, endeavouring
to recollect himself, &ldquo;thou art a fearful&mdash;a
detestable man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fearful?&rdquo; answered the bravo; &ldquo;dost thou
think me so?&nbsp; Good, that glads me to the very heart!&nbsp;
Detestable? that may be so, or it may not.&nbsp; I confess, the
sign which I hang out gives no great promise of good
entertainment within; but yet, Andreas, one thing is
certain.&nbsp; You and I stand on the same line, for at this
moment we are the two greatest men in Venice; you in your way, I
in mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doge could not help smiling at the bravo&rsquo;s familiar
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; continued Abellino, &ldquo;no smiles
of disbelief, if you please.&nbsp; Allow me, though a bravo, to
compare myself to a Doge; truly, I think there&rsquo;s no great
presumption in placing myself on a level with a man whom I hold
in my power, and who therefore is in fact beneath me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doge made a movement, as he would have left him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; said Abellino, laughing rudely, and
he barred the Doge&rsquo;s passage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Accident seldom
unites in so small a space as this chamber a pair of such great
men.&nbsp; Stay where you are, for I have not done with you yet;
we must have a little conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me, Abellino,&rdquo; said the Doge, mustering up
all the dignity which he possessed; &ldquo;thou hast received
great talents from Nature: why dost thou employ them to so little
advantage?&nbsp; I here promise you, on my most sacred word,
pardon for the past, and protection for the future, will you but
name to me the villain who bribed you to assassinate Conari,
abjure your bloody trade, and accept an honest employment in the
service of the Republic.&nbsp; If this offer is rejected, at
least quit with all speed the territory of Venice, or I
swear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; interrupted Abellino; &ldquo;pardon and
protection, say you?&nbsp; It is long since I thought it worth my
while to care for such trifles.&nbsp; Abellino is able to protect
himself without foreign aid; and, as to pardon, mortals cannot
give absolution for sins like mine.&nbsp; On that day, when all
men must give in the list of their offences, then, too, will I
give in mine, but till then never.&nbsp; You would know the name
of him who bribed me to be Conari&rsquo;s murderer?&nbsp; Well,
well, you shall know it, but not to-day.&nbsp; I must quit with
all speed the Venetian territory? and wherefore; through fear of
thee?&nbsp; Ho! ho!&nbsp; Through fear of Venice?&nbsp; Ha,
Abellino fears not Venice; &rsquo;tis Venice that fears
Abellino!&nbsp; You would have me abjure my profession?&nbsp;
Well, Andreas, there is one condition, which,
perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name it,&rdquo; cried the Doge, eagerly; &ldquo;will
ten thousand sequins purchase your departure from the
Republic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would gladly give you twice as much myself, could you
recall the insult of offering Abellino so miserable a
bribe!&nbsp; No, Andreas, but one price can pay me: give me your
niece for my bride.&nbsp; I love Rosabella, the daughter of
Guiscard of Corfu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monster&mdash;what insolence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho!&nbsp; Patience, patience, good uncle, that is
to be.&nbsp; Will you accept my terms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name what sum will satisfy you, and it shall be yours
this instant, so you will only relieve Venice from your
presence.&nbsp; Though it should cost the Republic a million she
will be a gainer, if her air is no longer poisoned by your
breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&nbsp; Why, in fact, a million is not so great a
sum; for look you, Andreas, I have just sold for near <i>half</i>
a million the lives of your two dear friends, Manfrone and
Lomellino.&nbsp; Now give me Rosabella, and I break the
bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miscreant!&nbsp; Has Heaven no lightnings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not?&nbsp; Mark me!&nbsp; In four-and-twenty
hours shall Manfrone and Lomellino be food for fishes.&nbsp;
Abellino has said it.&nbsp; Away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with these words he drew a pistol from under his cloak,
and flashed it in the Doge&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Blinded by the
powder, and confused by the unexpected explosion, Andreas started
back, and sunk bewildered on a neighbouring sofa.&nbsp; He soon
recovered from his astonishment.&nbsp; He sprang from his seat to
summon his guards and seize Abellino; but Abellino had already
disappeared.</p>
<p>On that same evening were Parozzi and his confederates
assembled in the palace of the Cardinal Gonzaga.&nbsp; The table
was spread with the most luxurious profusion, and they arranged
over their flowing goblets plans for the Republic&rsquo;s
ruin.&nbsp; The Cardinal related how he had of late contrived to
insinuate himself into the Doge&rsquo;s good graces, and had
succeeded in impressing him with an opinion that the chiefs of
the confederacy were fit men to hold offices of important
trust.&nbsp; Contarino boasted that he doubted not before long to
be appointed to the vacant procuratorship.&nbsp; Parozzi reckoned
for <i>his</i> share upon Rosabella&rsquo;s hand, and the place
either of Lomellino or Manfrone, when once those two chief
obstacles to his hope should be removed.&nbsp; Such was the
conversation in which they were engaged, when the clock struck
twelve, the doors flew wide, and Abellino stood before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wine, there!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;the work is
done.&nbsp; Manfrone and Lomellino are at supper with the
worms.&nbsp; And I have thrown the Doge himself into such a fit
of terror that I warrant he will not recover himself
easily.&nbsp; Now answer are you content with me, you
bloodhounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next, then, for Flodoardo!&rdquo; shouted Parozzi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flodoardo!&rdquo; muttered Abellino between his teeth;
&ldquo;hum&mdash;hum&mdash;that&rsquo;s not so easy.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Book the Third.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE LOVERS.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Rosabella</span>, the idol of all Venice,
lay on the bed of sickness; a sorrow, whose cause was carefully
concealed from every one, undermined her health, and destroyed
the bloom of her beauty.&nbsp; She loved the noble Flodoardo; and
who could have known Flodoardo and not have loved him?&nbsp; His
majestic stature, his expressive countenance, his enthusiastic
glance, his whole being declared aloud&mdash;Flodoardo is
Nature&rsquo;s favourite, and Rosabella had been always a great
admirer of Nature.</p>
<p>But if Rosabella was ill, Flodoardo was scarcely better.&nbsp;
He confined himself to his own apartment; he shunned society, and
frequently made long journeys to different cities of the
Republic, in hopes of distracting his thoughts by change of place
from that object which, wherever he went, still pursued
him.&nbsp; He had now been absent for three whole weeks.&nbsp; No
one knew in what quarter he was wandering; and it was during this
absence that the so-long expected Prince of Monaldeschi arrived
at Venice to claim Rosabella as his bride.</p>
<p>His appearance, to which a month before Andreas looked forward
with such pleasing expectation, now afforded but little
satisfaction to the Doge.&nbsp; Rosabella was too ill to receive
her suitor&rsquo;s visits, and he did not allow her much time to
recover her health; for six days after his arrival at Venice the
Prince was found murdered in a retired part of one of the public
gardens.&nbsp; His sword lay by him unsheathed and bloody; his
tablets were gone, but one leaf had been torn from them and
fastened on his breast.&nbsp; It was examined, and found to
contain the following lines, apparently written in
blood:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let no one pretend to Rosabella&rsquo;s
hand, who is not prepared to share the fate of Monaldeschi.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;The Bravo,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Abellino</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, where shall I now fly for comfort? for
protection?&rdquo; exclaimed the Doge in despair, when this
dreadful news was announced.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, why, is Flodoardo
absent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anxiously did he now desire the youth&rsquo;s return, to
support him under the weight of these heavy misfortunes; nor was
it long before that desire was gratified.&nbsp; Flodoardo
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, noble youth!&rdquo; said the Doge, when he saw
the Florentine enter his apartment.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must not in
future deprive me of your presence for so long.&nbsp; I am now a
poor forsaken old man.&nbsp; You have heard that
Lomellino&mdash;that Manfrone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all,&rdquo; answered Flodoardo, with a
melancholy air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Satan has burst his chains, and now inhabits Venice
under the name of Abellino, robbing me of all that my soul holds
precious.&nbsp; Flodoardo, for Heaven&rsquo;s love, be cautious;
often, during your absence, have I trembled lest the
miscreant&rsquo;s dagger should have deprived me too of
<i>you</i>.&nbsp; I have much to say to you, my young friend, but
I must defer it till the evening.&nbsp; A foreigner of
consequence has appointed this hour for an audience, and I must
hasten to receive him&mdash;but in the evening&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by the appearance of Rosabella, who, with
tottering steps and pale cheeks, advanced slowly into the
apartment.&nbsp; She saw Flodoardo, and a faint blush overspread
her countenance.&nbsp; Flodoardo rose from his seat, and welcomed
her with an air of distant respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not go yet,&rdquo; said the Doge; &ldquo;perhaps in
half an hour I may be at liberty: in the meanwhile I leave you to
entertain my poor Rosabella.&nbsp; She has been very ill during
your absence; and I am still uneasy about her health.&nbsp; She
kept her bed till yesterday, and truly I think she has left it
too soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The venerable Doge quitted the apartment, and the lovers once
more found themselves alone.&nbsp; Rosabella drew near the
window; Flodoardo at length ventured to approach it also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signora,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are you still angry
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not angry with you,&rdquo; stammered out
Rosabella, and blushed as she recollected the garden scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have quite forgiven my
transgression?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your transgression?&rdquo; repeated Rosabella, with a
faint smile; &ldquo;yes, if it was a transgression, I have quite
forgiven it.&nbsp; Dying people ought to pardon those who have
trespassed against them, in order that they, in their turn, may
be pardoned their trespasses against Heaven&mdash;and I am dying;
I feel it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signora!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, &rsquo;tis past a doubt.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true, I
have quitted my sick-bed since yesterday; but I know well that I
am soon to return to it, never to leave it more.&nbsp; And
therefore&mdash;therefore, I now ask your pardon, signor, for the
vexation which I was obliged to cause to you the last time we
met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flodoardo replied not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you not forgive me?&nbsp; You must be very
difficult to appease&mdash;very revengeful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flodoardo replied not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you refuse my offered hand?&nbsp; Shall all be
forgotten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgotten, lady?&nbsp; Never, never&mdash;every word
and look of yours is stamped on my memory, never to be
effaced.&nbsp; I cannot forget a transaction in which <i>you</i>
bore a part: I cannot forget the scene that passed between us,
every circumstance is too precious and sacred.&nbsp; As to
<i>pardon</i>&rdquo;&mdash;he took her extended hand and pressed
it respectfully to his lips&mdash;&ldquo;I would to Heaven, dear
lady, that you had in truth injured me much, that I might have
much to forgive you.&nbsp; Alas! I have at present nothing to
pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both were now silent.&nbsp; At length Rosabella resumed the
conversation by saying&mdash;&ldquo;You have made a long absence
from Venice; did you travel far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And received much pleasure from your
journey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much; for everywhere I heard the praises of
Rosabella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count Flodoardo,&rdquo; she interrupted him with a look
of reprehension, but in a gentle voice, &ldquo;would you again
offend me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will soon be out of my power.&nbsp; Perhaps you
can guess what are my present intentions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To resume your travels soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly so; and the next time that I quit Venice, to
return to it no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more?&rdquo; she repeated, eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
not so, Flodoardo!&nbsp; Ah, can you leave me?&rdquo;&mdash;She
stopped, ashamed of her imprudence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you leave my
uncle?&nbsp; I meant to say.&nbsp; You do but jest, I doubt
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my honour, lady, I never was more in
earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whither, then, do you mean to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Malta, and assist the knights in their attacks upon
the corsairs of Barbary.&nbsp; Providence, perhaps, may enable me
to obtain the command of a galley, then will I call my vessel
&lsquo;Rosabella;&rsquo; then shall the war-cry be still
&lsquo;Rosabella;&rsquo; that name will render me
invincible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! this is a mockery, Count.&nbsp; I have not deserved
that you should sport with my feelings so cruelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to <i>spare</i> your feelings, signora, that I am
now resolved to fly from Venice; my presence might cause you some
uneasy moments.&nbsp; I am not the happy man whose sight is
destined to give you pleasure; I will, at least, avoid giving you
pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you really can resolve to abandon the Doge, whose
esteem for you is so sincere, whose friendship has always been so
warm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I value his friendship highly, but it is not sufficient
to make me happy, and could he lay kingdoms at my feet, still
would his friendship be insufficient to make me happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does, then, your happiness require so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does&mdash;much more than I have mentioned,
infinitely more.&nbsp; But one boon can make me happy; I have
begged for it on my knees.&rdquo;&nbsp; He caught her hand and
pressed it eagerly to his lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have begged for
it, Rosabella, and my suit has been rejected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a strange enthusiast,&rdquo; she said with
difficulty, and scarcely knew what she said, while Flodoardo drew
her gently nearer to him, and murmured in a supplicating voice,
&ldquo;Rosabella!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My happiness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gazed upon him for a moment undecided, then hastily drew
away her hand, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Leave me, this moment, I
command you.&nbsp; Leave me, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flodoardo clasped his hands together in despair and
anguish.&nbsp; He bowed his head in token of obedience.&nbsp; He
left her with slow steps and a melancholy air, and as he passed
the threshold, turned to bid her farewell for ever.&nbsp;
Suddenly she rushed towards him, caught his hand, and pressed it
to her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flodoardo,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I am thine!&rdquo;
and sank motionless at his feet.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A DANGEROUS PROMISE.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now who was so blessed as the
fortunate Flodoardo?&nbsp; The victory was his own, he had heard
the wished-for sentence pronounced by the lips of
Rosabella.&nbsp; He raised her from the ground, and placed her on
a sofa.&nbsp; Her blue eyes soon unclosed themselves once more,
and the first object which they beheld was Flodoardo kneeling at
her feet, while with one arm he encircled her waist.&nbsp; Her
head sank upon the shoulder of the man for whom she had breathed
so many sighs, who had occupied so many of her thoughts by day,
who had been present in so many of her dreams by night.</p>
<p>As they gazed in silent rapture on each other, they forgot
that they were mortals; they seemed to be transported to a
happier, to a better world.&nbsp; Rosabella thought that the
chamber in which she sat was transformed into an earthly
Paradise; invisible seraphs seemed to hallow by their protecting
presence the indulgence of her innocent affection, and she poured
forth her secret thanks to Him who had given her a heart
susceptible of love.</p>
<p>Through the whole course of man&rsquo;s existence, such a
moment as this occurs but once.&nbsp; Happy is he who sighs for
its arrival; happy is he who, when it arrives, has a soul worthy
of its enjoyment; happy is even he for whom that moment has long
been passed, so it passed not unenjoyed, for the recollection of
it still is precious.&nbsp; Sage philosophers, in vain do you
assure us that the raptures of a moment like this are mere
illusions of a heated imagination, scarcely more solid than an
enchanting dream, which fades before the sunbeams of truth and
reason.&nbsp; Alas! does there exist a happiness under the moon
which owes not its charms in some degree to the magic of
imagination!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are dear to me, Flodoardo,&rdquo; murmured
Rosabella, for Camilla and her counsels were quite forgotten;
&ldquo;oh, you are very, very dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth only thanked her by clasping her still closer to his
bosom, while, for the first time, he sealed her coral lips with
his own.</p>
<p>At that moment the door was suddenly thrown open.&nbsp; The
Doge Andreas re-entered the apartment: the expected stranger had
been suddenly taken ill, and Andreas was no sooner at liberty
than he hastened to rejoin his favourite.&nbsp; The rustling of
his garments roused the lovers from their dream of bliss.&nbsp;
Rosabella started from Flodoardo&rsquo;s embrace with a cry of
terror; Flodoardo quitted his kneeling posture, yet seemed by no
means disconcerted at the discovery.</p>
<p>Andreas gazed upon them for some minutes, with a look which
expressed at once anger, melancholy, and the most heartfelt
disappointment.&nbsp; He sighed deeply, cast his eyes towards
heaven, and in silence turned to leave the apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay yet one moment, noble Andreas,&rdquo; cried the
Florentine.</p>
<p>The Doge turned, and Flodoardo threw himself at his
feet.&nbsp; Andreas looked down with calm and serious dignity on
the kneeling offender, by whom his friendship had been so
unworthily rewarded, and by whom his confidence had been so
cruelly betrayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said he, in a stern voice, &ldquo;the
attempt to excuse yourself must be fruitless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse myself!&rdquo; interrupted Flodoardo, boldly;
&ldquo;no, my lord, I need no excuses for loving Rosabella;
&rsquo;twere for him to excuse himself who had seen Rosabella and
<i>not</i> loved her; yet, if it is indeed a crime in me that I
adore Rosabella, &rsquo;tis a crime of which Heaven itself will
absolve me, since it formed Rosabella so worthy to be
adored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to lay too much stress on this fantastic
apology,&rdquo; answered the Doge, contemptuously; &ldquo;at
least you cannot expect that it should have much weight with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say it once more, my lord,&rdquo; resumed Flodoardo,
while he rose from the ground, &ldquo;that I intend to make no
apology; I mean not to excuse my love for Rosabella, but to
request your approbation of that love.&nbsp; Andreas, I adore
your niece; I demand her for my bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doge started in astonishment at this bold and unexpected
request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; continued the Florentine, &ldquo;I
am no more than a needy, unknown youth, and it seems a piece of
strange temerity when such a man proposes himself to espouse the
heiress of the Venetian Doge.&nbsp; But, by Heaven, I am
confident that the great Andreas means not to bestow his
Rosabella on one of those whose claims to favour are overflowing
coffers, extensive territories, and sounding titles, or who
vainly decorate their insignificance with the glory obtained by
the titles of their ancestors, glory of which they are themselves
incapable of acquiring a single ray.&nbsp; I acknowledge freely
that I have as yet performed no actions which make me deserving
of such a reward as Rosabella; but it shall not be long ere I
<i>will</i> perform such actions, or perish in the
attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doge turned from him with a look of displeasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, be not incensed with him, dear uncle,&rdquo; said
Rosabella.&nbsp; She hastened to detain the Doge, threw her white
arms around his neck fondly, and concealed in his bosom the tears
with which her countenance was bedewed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make your demands,&rdquo; continued Flodoardo, still
addressing himself to the Doge; &ldquo;say what you wish me to
do, and what you would have me become, in order to obtain from
you the hand of Rosabella.&nbsp; Ask what you will, I will look
on the task, however difficult, as nothing more than sport and
pastime.&nbsp; By Heaven, I would that Venice were at this moment
exposed to the most imminent danger, and that ten thousand
daggers were unsheathed against your life; Rosabella my
reward&mdash;how certain should I be to rescue Venice, and strike
the ten thousand daggers down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have served the Republic faithfully and fervently for
many a long year,&rdquo; answered Andreas, with a bitter smile;
&ldquo;I have risked my life without hesitation; I have shed my
blood with profusion; I asked nothing for my reward but to pass
my old age in soft tranquillity, and of this reward have I been
cheated.&nbsp; My bosom friends, the companions of my youth, the
confidants of my age, have been torn from me by the daggers of
banditti; and you, Flodoardo, you, on whom I heaped all favours,
have now deprived me of this my only remaining comfort.&nbsp;
Answer me, Rosabella; hast thou in truth bestowed thy heart on
Flodoardo irrevocably?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One hand of Rosabella&rsquo;s still rested on her
uncle&rsquo;s shoulder; with the other she clasped
Flodoardo&rsquo;s and pressed it fondly against her
heart&mdash;yet Flodoardo seemed still unsatisfied.&nbsp; No
sooner had the Doge&rsquo;s question struck his ear, than his
countenance became dejected; and though his hand returned the
pressure of Rosabella&rsquo;s, he shook his head mournfully, with
an air of doubt, and cast on her a penetrating look, as would he
have read the secrets of her inmost soul.</p>
<p>Andreas withdrew himself gently from Rosabella&rsquo;s arm,
and for some time paced the apartment slowly, with a countenance
sad and earnest.&nbsp; Rosabella sank upon a sofa which stood
near her, and wept.&nbsp; Flodoardo eyed the Doge, and waited for
his decision with impatience.</p>
<p>Thus passed some minutes.&nbsp; An awful silence reigned
through the chamber; Andreas seemed to be labouring with some
resolution of dreadful importance.&nbsp; The lovers wished, yet
dreaded, the conclusion of the scene, and with every moment their
anxiety became more painful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flodoardo!&rdquo; at length said the Doge, and suddenly
stood still in the middle of the chamber.&nbsp; Flodoardo
advanced with a respectful air.&nbsp; &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;I am at length resolved; Rosabella loves you,
nor will I oppose the decision of her heart; but Rosabella is
much too precious to admit of my bestowing her on the first who
thinks fit to demand her.&nbsp; The man to whom I give her must
be worthy such a gift.&nbsp; She must be the reward of his
services; nor can he do services so great that such a reward will
not overpay them.&nbsp; Your claims on the Republic&rsquo;s
gratitude are as yet but trifling; an opportunity now offers of
rendering as an essential service.&nbsp; The murderer of Conari,
Manfrone, and Lomellino&mdash;go, bring him hither!&nbsp; Alive
or dead, thou must bring to this palace the terrible
banditti-king, <i>Abellino</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this unexpected conclusion of a speech on which his
happiness or despair depended, Flodoardo started back.&nbsp; The
colour fled from his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My noble lord!&rdquo; he said at length, hesitating,
&ldquo;you know well that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know well,&rdquo; interrupted Andreas, &ldquo;how
difficult a task I enjoin, when I require the delivery of
Abellino.&nbsp; For myself I swear that I had rather a thousand
times force my passage with a single vessel through the whole
Turkish fleet, and carry off the admiral&rsquo;s ship from the
midst of them, than attempt to seize this Abellino, who seems to
have entered into a compact with Lucifer himself: who is to be
found everywhere and nowhere; whom so many have seen, but whom no
one knows; whose cautious subtlety has brought to shame the
vigilance of our State inquisitors, of the College of Ten, and of
all their legions of spies and sbirri; whose very name strikes
terror into the hearts of the bravest Venetians, and from whose
dagger I myself am not safe upon my throne.&nbsp; I know well,
Flodoardo, how much I ask; but I know also how much I
proffer.&nbsp; You seem irresolute?&nbsp; You are silent?&nbsp;
Flodoardo, I have long watched you with attention.&nbsp; I have
discovered in you marks of a superior genius, and therefore I am
induced to make such a demand.&nbsp; If any one is able to cope
with Abellino, thou art the man.&nbsp; I wait your
answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flodoardo paced the chamber in silence.&nbsp; Dreadful was the
enterprise proposed.&nbsp; Woe to him should Abellino discover
his purpose.&nbsp; But Rosabella was the reward.&nbsp; He cast a
look on the beloved one, and resolved to risk everything.</p>
<p>He advanced towards the Doge.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;Now, then, Flodoardo&mdash;your
resolution?</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;Should I deliver Abellino into your
power, do you solemnly swear that Rosabella shall be my
bride?</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;She shall! and <i>not till then</i>.</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i>.&mdash;Ah!&nbsp; Flodoardo, I fear this
undertaking will end fatally.&nbsp; Abellino is so crafty, so
dreadful.&nbsp; Oh! look well to yourself, for should you meet
with the detested monster, whose dagger&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i> (interrupting her hastily).&mdash;Oh!
silence, Rosabella&mdash;at least allow me to hope.&nbsp; Noble
Andreas, give me your hand, and pledge your princely word that,
Abellino once in your power, nothing shall prevent me from being
Rosabella&rsquo;s husband.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;I swear it; deliver into my power,
either alive or dead, this most dangerous foe of Venice, and
nothing shall prevent Rosabella from being your wife.&nbsp; In
pledge of which I here give you my princely hand.</p>
<p>Flodoardo grasped the Doge&rsquo;s hand in silence, and shook
it thrice.&nbsp; He turned to Rosabella, and seemed on the point
of addressing her, when he suddenly turned away, struck his
forehead, and measured the apartment with disordered and unsteady
steps.&nbsp; The clock in the tower of St. Mark&rsquo;s church
struck five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time flies!&rdquo; cried Flodoardo; &ldquo;no more
delay, then.&nbsp; In four-and-twenty hours will I produce in
this very palace this dreaded bravo, Abellino.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andreas shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;be less confident in your promises; I shall have more
faith in your performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i> (serious and firm).&mdash;Let things
terminate as they may, either I will keep my word, or never again
will cross the threshold of your palace.&nbsp; I have discovered
some traces of the miscreant, and I trust that I shall amuse you
to-morrow, at this time and in this place, with the
representation of a comedy; but should it prove a tragedy
instead, God&rsquo;s will be done.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;Remember that too much haste is
dangerous; rashness will destroy even the frail hopes of success
which you may reasonably indulge at present.</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;Rashness, my lord?&nbsp; He who has
lived as I have lived, and suffered what I have suffered, must
have been long since cured of rashness.</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i> (taking his hand).&mdash;Yet be not too
confident of your own strength, I beseech you!&nbsp; Dear
Flodoardo, my uncle loves you, and his advice is wise!&nbsp;
Beware of Abellino&rsquo;s dagger!</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;The best way to escape his dagger is
not to allow him time to use it: within four-and-twenty hours
must the deed be done, or never.&nbsp; Now, then, illustrious
Prince, I take my leave of you.&nbsp; To-morrow I doubt not to
convince you that nothing is too much for love to venture.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;Right; to venture: but to achieve?</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;Ah, that must depend&mdash;He paused
suddenly again his eyes were fastened eagerly on those of
Rosabella, and it was evident that with every moment his
uneasiness acquired fresh strength.&nbsp; He resumed his
discourse to Andreas, with a movement of impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noble Andreas,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do not make me
dispirited; rather let me try whether I cannot inspire you with
more confidence of my success.&nbsp; I must first request you to
order a splendid entertainment to be prepared.&nbsp; At this hour
in the afternoon of to-morrow let me find all the principal
persons in Venice, both men and women, assembled in this chamber;
for should my hopes be realised, I would willingly have
spectators of my triumph.&nbsp; Particularly let the venerable
members of the College of Ten he invited, in order that they may
at last he brought face to face with this terrible Abellino,
against whom they have so long been engaged in fruitless
warfare.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i> (after eyeing him some time with a look of
mingled surprise and uncertainty).&mdash;They shall be
present.</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;I understand, also, that since
Conari&rsquo;s death you have been reconciled to the Cardinal
Gonzaga; and that he has convinced you how unjust were the
prejudices with which Conari had inspired you against the
nobility&mdash;Parozzi, Contarino, and the rest of that
society.&nbsp; During my late excursions I have heard much in
praise of these young men, which makes me wish to show myself to
them in a favourable light.&nbsp; If you have no objection, let
me beg you to invite them also.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;You shall be gratified.</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;One thing more, which had nearly
escaped my memory.&nbsp; Let no one know the motive of this
entertainment till the whole company is assembled.&nbsp; Then let
guards be placed around the palace, and, indeed, it may be as
well to place them even before the doors of the saloon; for in
truth this Abellino is such a desperate villain, that too many
precautions cannot be taken against him.&nbsp; The sentinels must
have their pieces loaded, and, above all things, they must be
strictly charged, on pain of death, to let every one enter, but
no one quit the chamber.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;All this shall be done punctually.</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;I have nothing more to say.&nbsp;
Noble Andreas, farewell.&nbsp; Rosabella, to-morrow, when the
clock strikes five, we shall meet again, or never.</p>
<p>He said, and rushed out of the apartment.&nbsp; Andreas shook
his head; while Rosabella sank upon her uncle&rsquo;s bosom, and
wept bitterly.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE MIDNIGHT MEETING.</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Victory</span>!&rdquo; shouted
Parozzi, as he rushed into the Cardinal Gonzaga&rsquo;s chamber,
where the chief conspirators were all assembled; &ldquo;our work
goes on bravely.&nbsp; Flodoardo returned this morning to Venice,
and Abellino has already received the required sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Gonzaga</i>.&mdash;Flodoardo does not want talents; I had
rather he should live and join our party.&nbsp; He is seldom off
his guard&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Such vagabonds may well be cautious;
they must not forget themselves, who have so much to conceal from
others.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Rosabella, as I understand, by no means
sees this Florentine with unfavourable eyes.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Oh, wait till to-morrow, and then he may
make love to the devil and his grandmother, if he likes it.&nbsp;
Abellino by that time will have wrung his neck round, I warrant
you.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;It is strange that, in spite of all
inquiries, I can learn but little at Florence respecting this
Flodoardo.&nbsp; My letters inform me that some time ago there
did exist a family of that name; but it has been long extinct, or
if any of its descendants are still in being at Florence, their
existence is quite a secret.</p>
<p><i>Gonzaga</i>.&mdash;Are you all invited to the Doge&rsquo;s
to-morrow?</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;All of us, without exception.</p>
<p><i>Gonzaga</i>.&mdash;That is well.&nbsp; It seems that my
recommendations have obtained some weight with him, since his
triumvirate has been removed.&nbsp; And in the evening a masked
ball is to be given.&nbsp; Did not the Doge&rsquo;s chamberlain
say so?</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;He did.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;I only hope there is no trick in all
this.&nbsp; If he should have been given a hint of our
conspiracy!&nbsp; Mercy on us! my teeth chatter at the
thought.</p>
<p><i>Gonzaga</i>.&mdash;Absurd!&nbsp; By what means should our
designs have been made known to him?&nbsp; The thing is
impossible.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;Impossible?&nbsp; What, when there&rsquo;s
scarce a cutpurse, housebreaker, or vagabond in Venice who has
not been enlisted in our service, would it be so strange if the
Doge discovered a little of the business?&nbsp; A secret which is
known to so many, how should it escape his penetration?</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Simpleton! the same thing happens to
him which happens to betrayed husbands.&nbsp; Everyone can see
the horns except the man who carries them.&nbsp; And yet I
confess it is full time that we should realise our projects, and
prevent the possibility of our being betrayed.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;You are right, friend; everything is
ready now.&nbsp; The sooner that the blow is struck the
better.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Nay, the discontented populace, which at
present sides with us, would be perfectly well pleased if the
sport began this very night; delay the business longer, and their
anger against Andreas will cool, and render them unfit for our
purpose.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Then let us decide the game at once;
be to-morrow the important day.&nbsp; Leave the Doge to my
disposal.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll at least engage to bury my poniard in
his heart, and then let the business end as it may, one of two
things must happen: either we shall rescue ourselves from all
trouble and vexation, by throwing everything into uproar and
confusion, or else we shall sail with a full wind from this
cursed world to another.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Mark me, friends, we must go armed to
the Doge&rsquo;s entertainment.</p>
<p><i>Gonzaga</i>.&mdash;All the members of the College of Ten
have been particularly invited&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Down with every man of them!</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;Aye, aye!&nbsp; Fine talking, but suppose
it should turn out to be down with ourselves?</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Thou white-livered wretch!&nbsp; Stay at
home, then, and take care of your worthless existence.&nbsp; But
if our attempt succeeds, come not to us to reimburse you for the
sums which you have already advanced.&nbsp; Not a sequin shall be
paid you back, depend on&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;You wrong me, Falieri; if you wish to
prove my courage, draw your sword and measure it against
mine.&nbsp; I am as brave as yourself; but, thank Heaven, I am
not quite so hot-headed.</p>
<p><i>Gonzaga</i>.&mdash;Nay, even suppose that the event should
not answer our expectations?&nbsp; Andreas once dead, let the
populace storm as it pleases; the protection of his Holiness will
sanction our proceedings.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;The Pope?&nbsp; May we count on his
protection?</p>
<p><i>Gonzaga</i> (throwing him a letter).&mdash;Read there,
unbeliever.&nbsp; The Pope, I tell you, must protect us, since
one of our objects is professed to be the assertion of the rights
of St. Peter&rsquo;s Chair in Venice.&nbsp; Prithee, Memmo, tease
us no more with such doubts, but let Contarino&rsquo;s proposal
be adopted at once.&nbsp; Our confederates must be summoned to
Parozzi&rsquo;s palace with all diligence, and there furnished
with such weapons as are necessary.&nbsp; Let the stroke of
midnight be the signal for Contarino&rsquo;s quitting the
ball-room, and hastening to seize the arsenal.&nbsp; Salviati,
who commands there, is in our interest, and will throw open the
gates at the first summons.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;The admiral Adorna, as soon as he hears
the alarm-bell, will immediately lead his people to our
assistance.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Oh, our success is certain.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Only let us take care to make the
confusion as general as possible.&nbsp; Our adversaries must be
kept in the dark who are their friends and who their foes, and
all but our own party must be left ignorant as to the authors,
the origin, and the object of the uproar.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;Heaven, I am delighted at finding the
business at length so near the moment of execution!</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Parozzi, have you distributed the white
ribbons by which we are to recognise our partisans?</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;That was done some days ago.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Then there is no more necessary to be
said on the subject.&nbsp; Comrades, fill your goblets.&nbsp; We
will not meet again together till our work has been
completed.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;And yet methinks it would not be unwise to
consider the matter over again coolly.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Pshaw! consideration and prudence have
nothing to do with a rebellion; despair and rashness in this case
are better counsellors.&nbsp; The work once begun, the
constitution of Venice once boldly overturned, so that no one can
tell who is master and who is subject, then consideration will be
of service in instructing us how far it may be necessary for our
interest to push the confusion.&nbsp; Come, friends! fill, fill,
I say.&nbsp; I cannot help laughing when I reflect that, by
giving this entertainment to-morrow, the Doge himself kindly
affords us an opportunity of executing our plans.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;As to Flodoardo, I look upon him already
as in his grave; yet before we go to-morrow to the Doge&rsquo;s,
it will be as well to have a conference with Abellino.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;That care we will leave to you,
Parozzi, and in the meanwhile here&rsquo;s the health of
Abellino.</p>
<p><i>All</i>.&mdash;Abellino!</p>
<p><i>Gonzaga</i>.&mdash;And success to our enterprise
to-morrow.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;I&rsquo;ll drink <i>that</i> toast with
all my heart.</p>
<p><i>All</i>.&mdash;Success to to-morrow&rsquo;s enterprise!</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i>.&mdash;The wine tastes well, and every face
looks gay; pass eight-and-forty hours, and shall we look as
gaily?&nbsp; We separate smiling; shall we smile when two nights
hence we meet again?&nbsp; No matter.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE DECISIVE DAY.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning everything in
Venice seemed as tranquil as if nothing more than ordinary was on
the point of taking place; and yet, since her first foundation,
never had a more important day risen on the Republic.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the ducal palace were in motion
early.&nbsp; The impatient Andreas forsook the couch on which he
had passed a sleepless and anxious night, as soon as the first
sunbeams penetrated through the lattice of his chamber.&nbsp;
Rosabella had employed the hours of rest in dreams of Flodoardo,
and she still seemed to be dreaming of him, even after sleep was
fled.&nbsp; Camilla&rsquo;s love for her fair pupil had broken
her repose; she loved Rosabella as had she been her daughter, and
was aware that on this interesting day depended the love-sick
girl&rsquo;s whole future happiness.&nbsp; For some time
Rosabella was unusually gay; she sang to her harp the most lively
airs, and jested with Camilla for looking so serious and so
uneasy; but when mid-day approached, her spirits began to forsake
her.&nbsp; She quitted her instrument, and paced the chamber with
unsteady steps.&nbsp; With every succeeding hour her heart
palpitated with greater pain and violence, and she trembled in
expectation of the scene which was soon to take place.</p>
<p>The most illustrious persons in Venice already filled her
uncle&rsquo;s palace; the afternoon so much dreaded, and yet so
much desired, was come; and the Doge now desired Camilla to
conduct his niece to the great saloon, where she was expected
with impatience by all those who were of most consequence in the
Republic.</p>
<p>Rosabella sank on her knees before a statue of the
Virgin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed Lady!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with
lifted hands, &ldquo;have mercy on me!&nbsp; Let all to-day end
well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pale as death did she enter the chamber in which, on the day
before, she had acknowledged her love for Flodoardo, and
Flodoardo had sworn to risk his life to obtain her.&nbsp;
Flodoardo was not yet arrived.</p>
<p>The assembly was brilliant, the conversation was gay.&nbsp;
They talked over the politics of the day, and discussed the
various occurrences of Europe.&nbsp; The Cardinal and Contarino
were engaged in a conference with the Doge, while Memmo, Parozzi,
and Falieri stood silent together, and revolved the project whose
execution was to take place at midnight.</p>
<p>The weather was dark and tempestuous.&nbsp; The wind roared
among the waters of the canal, and the vanes of the palace-towers
creaked shrilly and discordantly.&nbsp; One storm of rain
followed hard upon another.</p>
<p>The clock struck four.&nbsp; The cheeks of Rosabella, if
possible, became paler than before.&nbsp; Andreas whispered
something to his chamberlain.&nbsp; In a few minutes the tread of
armed men seemed approaching the doors of the saloon, and soon
after the clattering of weapons was heard.</p>
<p>Instantly a sudden silence reigned through the whole
assembly.&nbsp; The young courtiers broke off their love-speeches
abruptly, and the ladies stopped in their criticisms upon the
last new fashions.&nbsp; The statesmen dropped their political
discussions, and gazed on each other in silence and anxiety.</p>
<p>The Doge advanced slowly into the midst of the assembly.&nbsp;
Every eye was fixed upon him.&nbsp; The hearts of the
conspirators beat painfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be not surprised, my friends,&rdquo; said Andreas,
&ldquo;at these unusual precautions; they relate to nothing which
need interfere with the pleasures of this society.&nbsp; You have
all heard but too much of the bravo Abellino, the murderer of the
Procurator Conari, and of my faithful counsellors Manfrone and
Lomellino, and to whose dagger my illustrious guest the Prince of
Monaldeschi has but lately fallen a victim.&nbsp; This miscreant,
the object of aversion to every honest man in Venice, to whom
nothing is sacred or venerable, and who has hitherto set at
defiance the whole vengeance of the Republic&mdash;before another
hour expires, perhaps this outcast of hell may stand before you
in this very saloon.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>All</i> (astonished).&mdash;Abellino?&nbsp; What, the bravo
Abellino?</p>
<p><i>Gonzaga</i>.&mdash;Of his own accord!</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;No, not of his own accord, in
truth.&nbsp; But Flodoardo of Florence has undertaken to render
this important service to the Republic, to seize Abellino, cost
what it may, and conduct him hither at the risk of his life.</p>
<p><i>A Senator</i>.&mdash;The engagement will be difficult to
fulfil.&nbsp; I doubt much Flodoardo&rsquo;s keeping his
promise.</p>
<p><i>Another</i>.&mdash;But if he <i>should</i> perform it, the
obligation which Flodoardo will lay upon the Republic will not be
trifling.</p>
<p><i>A Third</i>.&mdash;Nay, we shall be all his debtors, nor do
I know how we can reward Flodoardo for so important a
service.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;Be that my task.&nbsp; Flodoardo has
demanded my niece in marriage if he performs his promise.&nbsp;
Rosabella shall be his reward.</p>
<p>All gazed on each other in silence; some with looks expressing
the most heartfelt satisfaction, and others with glances of envy
and surprise.</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i> (in a low voice).&mdash;Parozzi, how will this
end?</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;As I live, the very idea makes me shake as
if I had a fever.</p>
<p><i>Parozzi</i> (smiling contemptuously).&mdash;It&rsquo;s very
likely that Abellino should suffer himself to be caught!</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Pray inform me, signors, have any of
you ever met this Abellino face to face?</p>
<p><i>Several Noblemen at once</i>.&mdash;Not I.&nbsp; Never.</p>
<p><i>A Senator</i>.&mdash;He is a kind of spectre, who only
appears now and then, when he is least expected and desired.</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i>.&mdash;I saw him once; never again shall I
forget the monster.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;And my interview with him is too well
known to make it needful for me to relate it.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;I have heard a thousand stories about this
miscreant, the one more wonderful than the other; and for my own
part I verily believe that he is Satan himself in a human
form.&nbsp; I must say that I think it would be wiser not to let
him be brought in among us, for he is capable of strangling us
all as we stand here, one after another, without mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious Heaven!&rdquo; screamed several of the ladies,
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t say so?&nbsp; What, strangle us in this
very chamber?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;The principal point is, whether
Flodoardo will get the better of <i>him</i>, or <i>he</i> of
Flodoardo.&nbsp; Now I would lay a heavy wager that the
Florentine will return without having finished the business.</p>
<p><i>A Senator</i>.&mdash;And <i>I</i> would engage, on the
contrary, that there is but one man in Venice who is capable of
seizing Abellino, and that <i>that</i> man is Flodoardo of
Florence.&nbsp; The moment that I became acquainted with him, I
prophesied that one day or other he would play a brilliant part
in the annals of history.</p>
<p><i>Another Senator</i>.&mdash;I think with you, signor.&nbsp;
Never was I so struck with a man at first sight as I was with
Flodoardo.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;A thousand sequins on Abellino&rsquo;s
not being taken, unless death should have taken him first.</p>
<p><i>The First Senator</i>.&mdash;A thousand sequins on
Flodoardo seizing him&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;And delivering him up to me, either
alive or dead.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Illustrious signors, you are witnesses
of the wager.&nbsp; My Lord Vitalba, there is my hand on
it.&nbsp; A thousand sequins!</p>
<p><i>The Senator</i>.&mdash;Done.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i> (smiling).&mdash;Many thanks for your gold,
signor.&nbsp; I look on it as already in my purse.&nbsp;
Flodoardo is a clever gentleman, no doubt, yet I would advise him
to take good care of himself; for he will find that Abellino
knows a trick or two, or I am much mistaken.</p>
<p><i>Gonzaga</i>.&mdash;May I request your Highness to inform me
whether Flodoardo is attended by the sbirri?</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;No, he is alone.&nbsp; Near
four-and-twenty hours have elapsed since he set out in pursuit of
the bravo.</p>
<p><i>Gonzaga</i> (to Contarino, with a smile of
triumph).&mdash;I wish you joy of your thousand sequins,
signor.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i> (bowing respectfully).&mdash;Since your
Excellency prophesies it I can no longer doubt my success.</p>
<p><i>Memmo</i>.&mdash;I begin to recover myself!&nbsp; Well,
well! let us see the end.</p>
<p>Three-and-twenty hours had elapsed since Flodoardo had entered
into the rash engagement.&nbsp; The four-and-twentieth now
hastened to its completion, and yet Flodoardo came not.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE CLOCK STRIKES FIVE.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Doge became uneasy.&nbsp; The
senator Vitalba began to tremble for his thousand sequins, and
the conspirators could not restrain their spiteful laughter, when
Contarino gravely declared that he would gladly lose, not
<i>one</i> thousand sequins, but twenty, if the loss of his wager
through Abellino&rsquo;s being captured might but secure the
general safety of the Republic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; cried Rosabella, &ldquo;the clock strikes
five!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All listened to the chimes in the tower of St. Mark&rsquo;s
Church, and trembled as they counted the strokes.&nbsp; Had not
Camilla supported her, Rosabella would have sank upon the
ground.&nbsp; The destined hour was past, and still Flodoardo
came not!</p>
<p>The venerable Andreas felt a sincere affection for the
Florentine; he shuddered as he dwelt upon the probability that
Abellino&rsquo;s dagger had prevailed.</p>
<p>Rosabella advanced towards her uncle as if she would have
spoken to him; but anxiety fettered her tongue, and tears forced
themselves into her eyes.&nbsp; She struggled for a while to
conceal her emotions, but the effort was too much for her.&nbsp;
She threw herself on a sofa, wrung her hands, and prayed to the
God of mercy for help and comfort.</p>
<p>The rest of the company either formed groups of whisperers, or
strolled up and down the apartment in evident uneasiness.&nbsp;
They would willingly have appeared gay and unconcerned, but they
found it impossible to assume even an affectation of gaiety, and
thus elapsed another hour, and still Flodoardo came not.</p>
<p>At that moment the evening sun broke through the clouds, and a
ray of its setting glory was thrown full upon the countenance of
Rosabella.&nbsp; She started from the sofa, extended her arms
towards the radiant orb, and exclaimed, while a smile of hope
played round her lips, &ldquo;God is merciful; God will have
mercy on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;Was it at five o&rsquo;clock that
Flodoardo engaged to produce Abellino?&nbsp; It is now a full
hour beyond his time.</p>
<p><i>The Senator Vitalba</i>.&mdash;Let him only produce him at
last, and he may be a month beyond his time if he choose.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;Hark!&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Silence!
silence!&nbsp; Surely I hear footsteps approaching the
saloon.</p>
<p>The words were scarcely spoken when the folding doors were
thrown open, and Flodoardo rushed into the room enveloped in his
mantle.&nbsp; His hair streamed on the air in wild disorder; a
deep shade was thrown over his face by the drooping plumes of his
<i>barrette</i>, from which the rain was flowing.&nbsp; Extreme
melancholy was impressed on all his features, and he threw gloomy
looks around him as he bowed his head in salutation of the
assembly.</p>
<p>Every one crowded round him; every mouth was unclosed to
question him; every eye was fixed on his face as if eager to
anticipate his answers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy Virgin!&rdquo; exclaimed Memmo, &ldquo;I am afraid
that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be silent, signor!&rdquo; interrupted Contarino,
sternly; &ldquo;there is nothing to be afraid of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Illustrious Venetians!&rdquo;&mdash;it was thus that
Flodoardo broke silence, and he spoke with the commanding tone of
a hero&mdash;&ldquo;I conclude that his Highness has already made
known to you the object of your being thus assembled.&nbsp; I
come to put an end to your anxiety; but first, noble Andreas, I
must once more receive the assurance that Rosabella of Corfu
shall become my bride, provided I deliver into your power the
bravo Abellino.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i> (examining his countenance with extreme
anxiety).&mdash;Flodoardo, have you succeeded?&nbsp; Is Abellino
your prisoner?</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;If Abellino is my prisoner, shall
Rosabella be my bride?</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;Bring me Abellino, alive or dead, and
she is yours.&nbsp; I swear it beyond the power of retracting,
and also that her dowry shall be royal!</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;Illustrious Venetians, ye have heard
the Doge&rsquo;s oath?</p>
<p><i>All</i>.&mdash;We are your witnesses.</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i> (advancing a few paces with a bold air, and
speaking in a firm voice).&mdash;Well, then, Abellino is in my
power&mdash;is in <i>yours</i>.</p>
<p><i>All</i> (in confusion and a kind of uproar).&mdash;In
ours?&nbsp; Merciful heaven!&nbsp; Where is he?&nbsp;
Abellino!</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;Is he dead or living?</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;He still lives.</p>
<p><i>Gonzaga</i> (hastily).&mdash;He lives?</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i> (bowing to the Cardinal
respectfully).&mdash;He still lives, signor.</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i> (pressing Camilla to her bosom).&nbsp; Didst
thou hear that, Camilla?&nbsp; Didst thou hear it?&nbsp; The
villain still lives.&nbsp; Not one drop of blood has stained the
innocent hand of Flodoardo.</p>
<p><i>The Senator Vitalba</i>.&mdash;Signor Contarino, I have won
a thousand sequins of you.</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i>.&mdash;So it should seem, signor.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;My son, you have bound the Republic to
you for ever, and I rejoice that it is to Flodoardo that she is
indebted for a service so essential.</p>
<p><i>Vitalba</i>.&mdash;And permit me, noble Florentine, to
thank you for this heroic act in the name of the Senate of
Venice.&nbsp; Our first care shall be to seek out a reward
proportioned to your merits.</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i> (extending his arms towards Rosabella, with a
melancholy air).&mdash;There stands the only reward for which I
wish.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i> (joyfully).&mdash;And that reward is your
own.&nbsp; But where have you left the bloodhound?&nbsp; Conduct
him hither, my son, and let me look at him once more.&nbsp; When
I last saw him, he had the insolence to tell me, &ldquo;Doge, I
am your equal.&nbsp; This narrow chamber now holds the two
greatest men in Venice.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, then, let me see how
this other great man looks in captivity.</p>
<p><i>Two or three Senators</i>.&mdash;Where is he?&nbsp; Bring
him hither.</p>
<p>Several of the ladies screamed at hearing this proposal.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; cried they, &ldquo;keep
the monster away from us!&nbsp; I shall be frightened out of my
senses if he comes here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noble ladies,&rdquo; said Flodoardo, with a smile,
expressing rather sorrow than joy, &ldquo;you have nothing to
apprehend.&nbsp; Abellino shall do you no harm; but he needs must
come hither to claim <i>The Bravo&rsquo;s Bride</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he pointed to Rosabella.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my best friend,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;how
shall I express my thanks to you for having thus put an end to my
terrors?&nbsp; I shall tremble no more at hearing Abellino
named.&nbsp; Rosabella shall now be called the Bravo&rsquo;s
Bride no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Falieri</i>.&mdash;Is Abellino already in this palace?</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;He is.</p>
<p><i>Vitalba</i>.&mdash;Then why do you not produce him?&nbsp;
Why do you trifle so long with our impatience?</p>
<p><i>Flodoardo</i>.&mdash;Be patient.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s now time
that the play should begin.&nbsp; Be seated, noble Andreas.&nbsp;
Let all the rest arrange themselves behind the Doge.&nbsp;
Abellino&rsquo;s coming!</p>
<p>At that word both old and young, both male and female, with
the rapidity of lightning, flew to take shelter behind
Andreas.&nbsp; Every heart beat anxiously; but as to the
conspirators, while expecting Abellino&rsquo;s appearance, they
suffered the torments of the damned.</p>
<p>Grave and tranquil sat the Doge in his chair, like a judge
appointed to pass sentence on this King of the Banditti.&nbsp;
The spectators stood around in various groups, all hushed and
solemn, as if they were waiting to receive their final
judgment.&nbsp; The lovely Rosabella, with all the security of
angels whose innocence have nothing to fear, reclined her head on
Camilla&rsquo;s shoulder and gazed on her heroic lover with looks
of adoration.&nbsp; The conspirators, with pallid cheeks and
staring eyes, filled up the background, and a dead and awful
silence prevailed through the assembly, scarcely interrupted by a
single breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, then,&rdquo; said Flodoardo, &ldquo;prepare
yourselves, for this terrible Abellino shall immediately appear
before you.&nbsp; Do not tremble; he shall do no one
harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he turned away from the company, advanced
towards the folding-doors.&nbsp; He paused for a few moments, and
concealed his face in his cloak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abellino!&rdquo; cried he at length, raising his head,
and extending his arm towards the door.&nbsp; At that name all
who heard it shuddered involuntarily, and Rosabella advanced
unconsciously a few steps towards her lover.&nbsp; She trembled
more for Flodoardo than herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abellino!&rdquo; the Florentine repeated, in a loud and
angry tone, threw from him his mantle and barrette, and had
already laid his hand on the lock of the door to open it, when
Rosabella uttered a cry of terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, Flodoardo!&rdquo; she cried, rushing towards him,
and&mdash;Ha!&nbsp; Flodoardo was gone, and there, in his place,
stood Abellino, and shouted out, &ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">APPARITIONS.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Instantly</span> a loud cry of terror
resounded through the apartment.&nbsp; Rosabella sank fainting at
the bravo&rsquo;s feet; the conspirators were almost suffocated
with rage, terror, and astonishment; the ladies made signs of the
cross, and began in all haste to repeat their paternosters; the
senators stood rooted to their places like so many statues; and
the Doge doubted the information of his ears and eyes.</p>
<p>Calm and terrible stood the bravo before them, in all the pomp
of his strange and awful ugliness, with his bravo&rsquo;s habit,
his girdle filled with pistols and poniards, his distorted yellow
countenance, his black and bushy eyebrows, his lips convulsed,
his right eye covered by a large patch, and his left half buried
among the wrinkles of flesh which swelled around it.&nbsp; He
gazed around him for a few moments in silence, and then
approached the stupefied Andreas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; he roared in a voice like thunder,
&ldquo;you wish to see the bravo Abellino?&nbsp; Doge of Venice,
here he stands, and is come to claim his bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andreas gazed with looks of horror on this model for demons,
and at length stammered out with difficulty, &ldquo;It cannot be
real; I must surely be the sport of some terrible
dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without there, guards!&rdquo; exclaimed the Cardinal
Gonzaga, and would have hastened to the folding doors, when
Abellino put his back against them, snatched a pistol from his
girdle, and pointed it at the Cardinal&rsquo;s bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;who calls for the
guard, or advances one step from the place on which he stands,
expires that moment.&nbsp; Fools!&nbsp; Do ye think I would have
delivered myself up, and desired that guards might beset these
doors, had I feared their swords, or intended to escape from your
power?&nbsp; No; I am content to be your prisoner, but not
through compulsion!&nbsp; I am content to be your prisoner; and
it was with that intent that I came hither.&nbsp; No mortal
should have the glory of seizing Abellino.&nbsp; If justice
required him to be delivered up, it was necessary that he should
be delivered up by himself!&nbsp; Or do ye take Abellino for an
ordinary ruffian, who passes his time in skulking from the
sbirri, and who murders for the sake of despicable plunder?&nbsp;
No, by heaven, no!&nbsp; Abellino was no such common
villain.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true I was a bravo; but the motives
which induced me to become one were great and
striking.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i> (clasping his hands together).&mdash;Almighty
God! can all this be possible?</p>
<p>An awful silence again reigned through the saloon.&nbsp; All
trembled while they listened to the voice of the terrible
assassin, who strode through the chamber proud and majestic as
the monarch of the infernal world.</p>
<p>Rosabella opened her eyes; their first look fell upon the
bravo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God of mercy!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;he is
still there.&nbsp; Methought, too, that Flodoardo&mdash;.&nbsp;
No, no; it could not be!&nbsp; I was deceived by
witchcraft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abellino advanced towards her, and attempted to raise
her.&nbsp; She shrunk from his touch with horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Rosabella,&rdquo; said the bravo, in an altered
voice, &ldquo;what you saw was no illusion.&nbsp; Your favoured
Flodoardo is no other than Abellino the bravo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is false!&rdquo; interrupted Rosabella, starting
from the ground in despair, and throwing herself for refuge on
Camilla&rsquo;s bosom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Monster! thou canst not be
Flodoardo! such a fiend can never have been such a seraph.&nbsp;
Flodoardo&rsquo;s actions were good and glorious as a
demi-god&rsquo;s!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas of him that I learned to love
good and glorious actions, and &rsquo;twas he who encouraged me
to attempt them myself; his heart was pure from all mean
passions, and capable of conceiving all great designs.&nbsp;
Never did he scruple, in the cause of virtue, to endure fatigue
and pain, and to dry up the tears of suffering
innocence&mdash;that was Flodoardo&rsquo;s proudest
triumph!&nbsp; Flodoardo and thou&mdash;!&nbsp; Wretch, whom many
a bleeding ghost has long since accused before the throne of
heaven, darest thou to profane the name of Flodoardo!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i> (proud and earnest).&mdash;Rosabella, wilt
thou forsake me?&nbsp; Wilt thou retract thy promise?&nbsp; Look,
Rosabella, and be convinced: I, the bravo, and thy Flodoardo are
the same.</p>
<p>He said, removing the patch from his eye, and passed a
handkerchief over his face once or twice.&nbsp; In an instant his
complexion was altered, his bushy eyebrows and straight black
hair disappeared, his features were replaced in their natural
symmetry, and lo! the handsome Florentine stood before the whole
assembly, dressed in the habit of the bravo Abellino.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;Mark me, Rosabella!&nbsp; Seven times
over, and seven times again, will I change my appearance, even
before your eyes, and that so artfully that, study me as you
will, the transformation shall deceive you.&nbsp; But change as I
may, of one thing be assured: I am the man whom you loved as
Flodoardo.</p>
<p>The Doge gazed and listened without being able to recover from
his confusion, but every now and then the words &ldquo;Dreadful!
dreadful!&rdquo; escaped from his lips, and he wrung his hands in
agony.&nbsp; Abellino approached Rosabella, and said in the tone
of supplication: &ldquo;Rosabella, wilt thou break thy
promise?&nbsp; Am I no longer dear to thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosabella was unable to answer; she stood like one changed to
a statue, and fixed her motionless eyes on the bravo.</p>
<p>Abellino took her cold hand and pressed it to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosabella,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;art thou still
mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i>.&mdash;Flodoardo, oh! that I had never loved,
had never seen thee!</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;Rosabella wilt thou still be the bride
of Flodoardo? wilt thou be &ldquo;the Bravo&rsquo;s
Bride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Love struggled with abhorrence in Rosabella&rsquo;s bosom, and
painful was the contest.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;Hear me, beloved one!&nbsp; It was for
thee that I have discovered myself&mdash;that I have delivered
myself into the hands of justice.&nbsp; For thee&mdash;oh, what
would I not do for thee!&nbsp; Rosabella, I wait but to hear one
syllable from your lips; speak but a decisive yes or no, and all
is ended.&nbsp; Rosabella, dost thou love me still?</p>
<p>And still she answered not; but she threw upon him a look
innocent and tender as ever beamed from the eye of an angel, and
that look betrayed but too plainly that the miscreant was still
master of her heart.&nbsp; She turned from him hastily, threw
herself into Camilla&rsquo;s arms, and exclaimed, &ldquo;God
forgive you, man, for torturing me so cruelly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doge had by this time recovered from his stupor.&nbsp; He
started from his chair, threats flashed from his eyes, and his
lips trembled with passion.&nbsp; He rushed towards Abellino; but
the senators threw themselves in his passage, and held him back
by force.&nbsp; In the meanwhile the bravo advanced towards him
with the most insolent composure, and requested him to calm his
agitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doge of Venice,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will you keep
your promise?&nbsp; That you gave it to me, these noble lords and
ladies can testify.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andreas.&mdash;Monster! miscreant!&nbsp; Oh! how artfully has
this plan been laid to ensnare me!&nbsp; Tell me, Venetians, to
<i>such</i> a creditor am I obliged to discharge my fearful
debt?&nbsp; Long has he been playing a deceitful bloody part; the
bravest of our citizens have fallen beneath his dagger, and it
was the price of their blood which has enabled him to act the
nobleman in Venice.&nbsp; Then comes he to me in disguise of a
man of honour, seduces the heart of my unfortunate Rosabella,
obtains my promise by an artful trick, and now claims the maiden
for his bride, in the hope that the husband of the Doge&rsquo;s
niece will easily obtain an absolution for his crimes.&nbsp; Tell
me, Venetians, ought I to keep my word with this miscreant?</p>
<p><i>All the Senators</i>.&mdash;No, no, by no means.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i> (with solemnity).&mdash;If you have once
pledged your word, you ought to keep it, though given to the
Prince of Darkness.&nbsp; Oh, fie, fie!&nbsp; Abellino, how
shamefully hast thou been deceived in thy reckoning.&nbsp; I
thought I had to do with men of honour.&nbsp; Oh! how grossly
have I been mistaken.&nbsp; (In a terrible voice.)&mdash;Once
again, and for the last time, I ask you, Doge of Venice, wilt
thou break thy princely word?</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i> (in the tone of authority).&mdash;Give up your
arms.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;And you will really withhold from me my
just reward?&nbsp; Shall it be in vain that I delivered Abellino
into your power?</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i>.&mdash;It was to the brave Flodoardo that I
promised Rosabella.&nbsp; I never entered into any engagement
with the murderer Abellino.&nbsp; Let Flodoardo claim my niece,
and she is his; but Abellino can have no claim to her.&nbsp;
Again I say lay down your arms.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i> (laughing wildly).&mdash;The murderer
Abellino, say you?&nbsp; Ho! ho!&nbsp; Be it your care to keep
your own promises, and trouble not yourself about my murders,
they are <i>my</i> affair, and I warrant I shall find a word or
two to say in defence of them, when the judgment day arrives.</p>
<p><i>Gonzaga</i> (to the Doge).&mdash;What dreadful
blasphemy.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;Oh, good Lord Cardinal, intercede in my
behalf, you know me well; I have always acted by you like a man
of honour, that at least you cannot deny.&nbsp; Say a word in my
favour, then, good Lord Cardinal.</p>
<p><i>Gonzaga</i> (angrily, and with imperious
dignity).&mdash;Address not thyself to <i>me</i>,
miscreant.&nbsp; What canst thou and I have to do together?&nbsp;
Venerable Andreas, delay no longer; let the guards be called
in.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;What?&nbsp; Is there then no hope for
me?&nbsp; Does no one feel compassion for the wretched
Abellino?&nbsp; What! <i>no one</i>?&mdash;(a pause)&mdash;All
are silent?&mdash;<i>all</i>!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis enough.&nbsp; Then
my fate is decided&mdash;call in your guards.</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i> (with a scream of agony, springing forward,
and falling at the feet of the Doge).&mdash;Mercy, mercy!&nbsp;
Pardon him&mdash;pardon <i>Abellino</i>!</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i> (in rapture).&mdash;Sayest thou so?&nbsp; Ho!
ho! then an angel prays for Abellino in his last moments.</p>
<p><i>Rosabella</i> (clasping the Doge&rsquo;s knees).&mdash;Have
mercy on him, my friend, my father, he is a sinner; but leave him
to the justice of Heaven.&nbsp; He is a sinner, but oh, Rosabella
loves him still.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i> (pushing her away with
indignation).&mdash;Away, unworthy girl; you rave.</p>
<p>Abellino folded his arms, gazed with eagerness on what was
passing, and tears gushed into his brilliant eyes.&nbsp;
Rosabella caught the Doge&rsquo;s hand, as he turned to leave
her, kissed it twice, and said, &ldquo;If you have no mercy on
<i>him</i>, then have none on <i>me</i>.&nbsp; The sentence which
you pass on Abellino will be mine; &rsquo;tis for my own life
that I plead as well as Abellino&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Father, dear
father, reject not my suit, but spare him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i> (in an angry and decided tone).&mdash;Abellino
dies.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;And can you look on with dry eyes while
that innocent dove bleeds at your feet?&nbsp; Go, barbarian; you
never loved Rosabella as she deserved.&nbsp; Now she is yours no
longer.&nbsp; She is mine, she is Abellino&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He raised her from the ground, and pressed her pale lips
against his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosabella, thou art mine; death alone can part
us.&nbsp; Thou lovest me as I <i>would</i> be loved; I am blest
whate&rsquo;er may happen, and can now set fortune at
defiance.&nbsp; To business, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replaced Rosabella, who was almost fainting, on the bosom
of Camilla, then advanced into the middle of the chamber, and
addressed the assembly with an undaunted air&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Venetians, you are determined to deliver me up to the
axe of justice; there is for me no hope of mercy.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis well, act as you please; but ere you sit in judgment
over <i>me</i>, signors, I shall take the liberty of passing
sentence upon some few of <i>you</i>.&nbsp; Now mark me, you see
in me the murderer of Conari, the murderer of Paolo Manfrone, the
murderer of Lomellino.&nbsp; I deny it not.&nbsp; But would you
know the illustrious persons who paid me for the use of my
dagger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he put a whistle to his lips, sounded it, and
instantly the doors flew open, the guards rushed in, and ere they
had time to recollect themselves, the chief conspirators were in
custody, and disarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guard them well,&rdquo; said Abellino, in a terrible
voice to the sentinels; &ldquo;you have your orders.&nbsp; Noble
Venetians, look on these villains; it is to them that you are
indebted for the loss of your three citizens.&nbsp; I accuse of
those murders one, two, three, four, and my good Lord Cardinal
there has the honour to be the fifth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Motionless and bewildered stood the accused; tale-telling
confusion spoke in every feature that the charge was true, and no
one was bold enough to contradict Abellino.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can all this mean?&rdquo; asked the senators of
each other, in the utmost surprise and confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all a shameful artifice,&rdquo; the Cardinal at
length contrived to say; &ldquo;the villain, perceiving that he
has no chance of escaping punishment, is willing, out of mere
resentment, to involve us in his destruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Contarino</i> (recovering himself).&mdash;In the wickedness
of his life he has surpassed all former miscreants, and now he is
trying to surpass them in the wickedness of his death.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i> (with majesty).&mdash;Be silent.&nbsp; I know
your whole plot, have seen your list of proscriptions, am well
informed of your whole arrangement, and at the moment that I
speak to you the officers of justice are employed, by my orders,
in seizing the gentlemen with the white ribbons round their arms,
who this very night intended to overturn Venice.&nbsp; Be silent,
for defence were vain.</p>
<p><i>Andreas</i> (in astonishment)&mdash;Abellino, what is the
meaning of all this?</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;Neither more nor less than that
Abellino has discovered and defeated a conspiracy against the
constitution of Venice and the life of its Doge!&nbsp; The bravo,
in return for your kind intention of sending him to destruction
in a few hours, has preserved you from it.</p>
<p><i>Vitalba</i> (to the accused).&mdash;Noble Venetians, you
are silent under this heavy charge.</p>
<p><i>Abellino</i>.&mdash;They are wise, for no defence can now
avail them.&nbsp; Their troops are already disarmed, and lodged
in separate dungeons of the State prison; visit them there, and
you will learn more.&nbsp; You now understand probably that I did
not order the doors of this saloon to be guarded for the purpose
of seizing the terrible bravo Abellino, but of taking those
heroes into secure custody.</p>
<p>And now, Venetians, compare together <i>your</i> conduct and
<i>mine</i>.&nbsp; At the hazard of my life have I preserved the
State from ruin.&nbsp; Disguised as a bravo, I dared to enter the
assembly of those ruthless villains, whose daggers laid Venice
waste.&nbsp; I have endured for your sakes storm, and rain, and
frost, and heat; I have watched for your safety while you were
sleeping.&nbsp; Venice owes to my care her constitution and your
lives; and yet are my services deserving of no reward?&nbsp; All
this have I done for Rosabella of Corfu, and yet will you
withhold from me my promised bride?&nbsp; I have saved you from
death, have saved the honour of your wives, and the throats of
your innocent children from the knife of the assassin.&nbsp; Men!
men! and yet will you send me to the scaffold?</p>
<p>Look on this list!&nbsp; See how many among you would have
bled this night, had it not been for Abellino, and see where the
miscreants stand by whom you would have bled!&nbsp; Read you not
in every feature that they are already condemned by heaven and
their own conscience?&nbsp; Does a single mouth unclose itself in
exculpation?&nbsp; Does a single movement of the head give the
lie to my charge?&nbsp; Yet the truth of what I have advanced
shall be made still more evident.</p>
<p>He turned himself to the conspirators</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark me!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the first among you who
acknowledges the truth shall receive a free pardon.&nbsp; I swear
it, I, the bravo Abellino!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conspirators remained silent.&nbsp; Suddenly Memmo started
forward and threw himself trembling at the Doge&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Venetians,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;Abellino has
told you true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis false, &rsquo;tis false!&rdquo; exclaimed
the accused altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; cried Abellino, in a voice of thunder,
while the indignation which flamed in every feature struck terror
into his hearers: &ldquo;Silence, I say, and hear me, or rather
hear the ghosts of your victims.&nbsp; Appear, appear!&rdquo;
cried this dreadful man, in a tone still louder:
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he sounded his whistle.&nbsp; The folding doors were
thrown open, and there stood the Doge&rsquo;s much lamented
friends&mdash;Conari, Lomellino, and Manfrone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are betrayed!&rdquo; shouted Contarino, who drew out
a concealed dagger, and plunged it in his bosom up to the very
hilt.</p>
<p>And now what a scene of rapture followed.&nbsp; Tears streamed
down the silver beard of Andreas, as he rushed into the arms of
his long-lost companions; tears bedewed the cheeks of the
venerable triumvirate, as they once more clasped the knees of
their prince, their friend, their brother.&nbsp; These excellent
men, these heroes, never had Andreas hoped to meet them again
till they should meet in heaven; and Andreas blessed heaven for
permitting him to meet them once more on earth.&nbsp; These four
men, who had valued each other in the first dawn of <i>youth</i>,
who had fought by each other&rsquo;s sides in <i>manhood</i>,
were now assembled in <i>age</i>, and valued each other more than
ever.&nbsp; The spectators gazed with universal interest on the
scene before them, and the good old senators mingled tears of joy
with those shed by the re-united companions.&nbsp; In the happy
delirium of this moment, nothing but Andreas and his friends were
attended to; no one was aware that the conspirators and the
self-murderer Contarino were removed by the guards from the
saloon; no one but Camilla observed Rosabella, who threw herself
sobbing on the bosom of the handsome bravo, and repeated a
thousand times, &ldquo;Abellino, then, is not a
murderer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length they began to recollect themselves they looked round
them&mdash;and the first words which broke from every lip
were&mdash;&ldquo;Hail, saviour of Venice!&rdquo;&mdash;The roof
rung with the name of Abellino, and unnumbered blessings
accompanied the name.</p>
<p>That very Abellino, who not an hour before had been doomed to
the scaffold by the whole assembly, now stood calm and dignified
as a god before the adoring spectators; and now he viewed with
complacency the men whose lives he had saved, and now his eye
dwelt with rapture on the woman whose love was the reward of all
his dangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abellino!&rdquo; said Andreas advancing to the bravo,
and extending his hand towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not Abellino,&rdquo; replied he, smiling, while he
pressed the Doge&rsquo;s hand respectfully to his lips
&ldquo;neither am I Flodoardo of Florence.&nbsp; I am by birth a
Neapolitan, and by name Rosalvo.&nbsp; The death of my inveterate
enemy the Prince of Monaldeschi makes it no longer necessary to
conceal who I really am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monaldeschi?&rdquo; repeated Andreas, with a look of
anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear not,&rdquo; continued Rosalvo; &ldquo;Monaldeschi,
it is true, fell by my hand, but fell in honourable combat.&nbsp;
The blood which stained his sword flowed from my veins, and in
his last moments conscience asserted her empire in his
bosom.&nbsp; He died not till he had written in his tablets the
most positive declaration of my innocence as to the crimes with
which his hatred had contrived to blacken me; and he also
instructed me by what means I might obtain at Naples the
restoration of my forfeited estates and the re-establishment of
my injured honour.&nbsp; Those means have been already
efficacious, and all Naples is by this time informed of the arts
by which Monaldeschi procured my banishment, and of the many
plots which he laid for my destruction; plots, which made it
necessary for me to drop my own character, and never to appear
but in disguise.&nbsp; After various wanderings chance led me to
Venice.&nbsp; My appearance was so much altered, that I dreaded
not discovery, but I dreaded (and with reason) perishing in your
streets with hunger.&nbsp; In this situation accident brought me
acquainted with the banditti, by whom Venice was then
infested.&nbsp; I willingly united myself to their society,
partly with a view of purifying the Republic from the presence of
these wretches, and partly in the hope of discovering through
them the more illustrious villains by whom their daggers were
employed.&nbsp; I was successful.&nbsp; I delivered the banditti
up to justice, and stabbed their captain in Rosabella&rsquo;s
sight.&nbsp; I was now the only bravo in Venice.&nbsp; Every
scoundrel was obliged to have recourse to me.&nbsp; I discovered
the plans of the conspirators, and now you know them also.&nbsp;
I found that the deaths of the Doge&rsquo;s three friends had
been determined on; and in order to obtain full confidence with
the confederates, it was necessary to persuade them that these
men had fallen beneath my dagger.&nbsp; No sooner had my plan
been formed than I imparted it to Lomellino.&nbsp; He, and he
only, was my confidant in this business.&nbsp; He presented me to
the Doge as the son of a deceased friend; he assisted me with his
advice; he furnished me with keys to those doors to the public
gardens, which none were permitted to pass through except Andreas
and his particular friends, and which frequently enabled me to
elude pursuit; he showed me several private passages in the
palace by which I could penetrate unobserved even into the
Doge&rsquo;s very bed-chamber.&nbsp; When the time for his
disappearance arrived, he not only readily consented to lie
concealed in a retreat known only to ourselves, but was also the
means of inducing Manfrone and Conari to join him in his
retirement, till the fortunate issue of this day&rsquo;s
adventure permitted me to set them once more at liberty.&nbsp;
The banditti exist no longer; the conspirators are in chains; my
plans are accomplished; and now, Venetians, if you still think
him deserving of it, here stands the bravo Abellino, and you may
lead him to the scaffold when you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the scaffold!&rdquo; exclaimed at once the Doge, the
senators, and the whole crowd of nobility; and every one burst
into enthusiastic praises of the dauntless Neapolitan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Abellino,&rdquo; exclaimed Andreas, while he wiped
away a tear, &ldquo;I would gladly give my ducal bonnet to be
such a bravo as thou hast been.&nbsp; &lsquo;Doge,&rsquo; did
thou once say to me, &lsquo;thou and I are the two greatest men
in Venice,&rsquo; but oh, how much greater is the bravo than the
Doge!&nbsp; Rosabella is that jewel, than which I have nothing in
the world more precious; Rosabella is dearer to me than an
emperor&rsquo;s crown; Rosabella is thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abellino,&rdquo; said Rosabella, and extended her hand
to the handsome Bravo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Triumph!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;Rosabella is the
Bravo&rsquo;s Bride,&rdquo; and he clasped the blushing maid to
his bosom.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CONCLUSION.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now it would not be at all
amiss to make Count Rosalvo sit down quietly between the good old
Doge and his lovely niece; and then cause him to relate the
motive of Monaldeschi&rsquo;s hatred, in what manner he lost
Valeria, what crimes were imputed to him, and how he escaped from
the assassins sent in pursuit of him by his enemy; how he had
long wandered from place to place, and how he had at length
learned, during his abode in Bohemia with a gang of gipsies, such
means of disguising his features as enabled him to defy the
keenest penetration to discover in the beggar Abellino the once
admired Count Rosalvo; how in this disguise he had returned to
Italy; and how Lomellino, having ascertained that he was
universally believed at Naples to have long since perished by
shipwreck, and therefore that neither the officers of the
Inquisition, nor the assassins of his enemies were likely to
trouble themselves any more about him, he had ventured to resume,
with some slight alterations, his own appearance at Venice; how
the arrival of Monaldeschi had obliged him to conceal himself,
till an opportunity offered of presenting himself to the Prince
when unattended, and of demanding satisfaction for his injuries;
how he had been himself wounded in several places by his
antagonist, though the combat finally terminated in his favour;
how he had resolved to make use of Monaldeschi&rsquo;s death to
terrify Andreas still further, and of Parozzi&rsquo;s conspiracy
to obtain Rosabella&rsquo;s hand of the Doge; how he had trembled
lest the heart of his mistress should have been only captivated
by the romantic appearance of the adventurer Flodoardo, and have
rejected him when known to be the bravo Abellino; how he had
resolved to make use of the terror inspired by the assassin to
put her love to the severest trial; and how, had she failed in
that trial, he had determined to renounce the inconstant maid for
ever; with many other <i>hows</i>, <i>whys</i>, and
<i>wherefores</i>, which, not being explained, will, I doubt,
leave much of this tale involved in mystery: but before I begin
Rosalvo&rsquo;s history, I must ask two
questions&mdash;First&mdash;do my readers like the manner in
which I relate adventures?</p>
<p>Secondly&mdash;If my readers <i>do</i> like my manner of
relating adventures, can I employ my time better than in relating
them?</p>
<p>When these questions are answered, I may probably resume my
pen.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, gentlemen and ladies, good-night,
and pleasant dreams attend you.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
